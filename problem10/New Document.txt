Explanation
Algorithm Approach
This problem uses the Dinic's algorithm for maximum flow, which efficiently computes the maximum flow in a flow network. The key steps are:

Graph Construction:

Create a super-source connected to all restaurants (capacity = number of drivers)

Create a super-sink connected to all customers (capacity = customer demand)

Convert roads to edges with their given capacities

Flow Computation:

Use BFS to find augmenting paths and assign levels to nodes

Use DFS to push flow along blocking paths

Repeat until no more augmenting paths exist

Why This Works
The problem translates directly to a max-flow problem where we need to move "flow" (deliveries) from sources (restaurants) to sinks (customers)

Road capacities naturally become edge capacities in the flow network

The algorithm efficiently handles multiple sources and sinks through the super-node technique

Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(V²E) where V is number of vertices and E is number of edges

Space Complexity: O(V + E) for storing the graph

For the given constraints (n ≤ 200, m ≤ 2000), this is efficient

Sample Walkthrough
For Test Case 1:

Restaurant at location 0 has 10 drivers

Customer at location 1 has demand for 8 deliveries

Road 0→1 has capacity 15 (more than enough)

Maximum flow = min(10, 8) = 8 deliveries

The solution efficiently handles complex delivery routing scenarios and finds the optimal delivery plan using network flow principles.
