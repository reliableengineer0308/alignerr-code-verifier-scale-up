Problem: Find Peak Element in Mountain Array

Description:
A mountain array is defined as an array that:
- Increases strictly to some peak element
- Decreases strictly after the peak element

Given a mountain array, find the index of the peak element. The array is guaranteed to be a mountain array.

You must solve this in O(log n) time complexity using binary search.

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases, 1 ≤ T ≤ 100)
- For each test case:
  - First line: n (array length, 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
  - Second line: n integers (mountain array elements, 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9)

Output:
- For each test case:
  - Print "Case #X: Y" where X is test case number, Y is the index (0-based) of the peak element

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
3
5
1 3 5 4 2
7
1 2 3 4 3 2 1
4
0 1 0 -1

Output:
Case #1: 2
Case #2: 3
Case #3: 1

Explanation:
Case 1: Array [1, 3, 5, 4, 2] - peak is 5 at index 2
Case 2: Array [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1] - peak is 4 at index 3  
Case 3: Array [0, 1, 0, -1] - peak is 1 at index 1

Algorithm:
Use binary search to find the peak:
- Compare middle element with its right neighbor
- If arr[mid] < arr[mid+1], search in right half (peak is to the right)
- Else, search in left half (peak is to the left, or mid is the peak)

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- The array is guaranteed to be a mountain array
