Problem: Subset Sum Closest to Target using Meet in the Middle

Description:
Given a set of n integers and a target value T, find the subset sum that is closest to T.
Since n can be up to 40, brute force (2^40) is too slow. Use meet-in-the-middle technique.

Split the array into two halves, generate all subset sums for each half, then combine results.

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases, 1 ≤ T ≤ 10)
- For each test case:
  - First line: n target (array size and target sum, 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, -10^9 ≤ target ≤ 10^9)
  - Second line: n integers (array elements, -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9)

Output:
- For each test case:
  - Print "Case #X: Y" where X is test case number, Y is the closest subset sum to target

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
3
5 10
1 2 3 4 5
4 7
-1 2 3 4
6 100
10 20 30 40 50 60

Output:
Case #1: 10
Case #2: 7
Case #3: 100

Explanation:
Case 1: Subset [1,2,3,4] sums to 10, which equals target
Case 2: Subset [3,4] sums to 7, which equals target
Case 3: Subset [10,20,30,40] sums to 100, equals target

Algorithm:
1. Split array into two halves A and B
2. Generate all subset sums for A and store in sorted list
3. Generate all subset sums for B
4. For each sum in B, use binary search to find best matching sum in A such that (sum_A + sum_B) is closest to target
5. Track the best overall sum

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 40
- -10^9 ≤ target, a_i ≤ 10^9
