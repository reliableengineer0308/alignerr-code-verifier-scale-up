Problem: Convex Hull with Collinear Points Handling

Description:
Given a set of points in a 2D plane, find the convex hull that includes all collinear points on the hull edges.
Unlike standard convex hull algorithms that exclude collinear points, this version should include all points that lie on the convex hull boundary.

The convex hull should be returned in counter-clockwise order starting from the bottom-most point (and leftmost in case of ties).

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases)
- For each test case:
  - First line: N (number of points)
  - Next N lines: x y (coordinates of each point)

Output:
- For each test case:
  - Print "Case #X: M" where X is test case number, M is number of points in convex hull
  - Next M lines: x y (coordinates of convex hull points in counter-clockwise order)

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
- -10000 ≤ x, y ≤ 10000
- No two points are identical

Algorithm Requirements:
- Implement modified Graham Scan or Andrew's algorithm
- Handle collinear points properly (include all points on hull edges)
- Sort points appropriately for convex hull construction

Example:
Input:
2
8
0 0
0 4
4 0
4 4
2 2
1 1
3 3
2 0
6
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
5 5
1 3

Output:
Case #1: 5
0 0
2 0
4 0
4 4
0 4
Case #2: 6
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
5 5
1 3

Explanation:
In the first case, points (2,2) and (1,1) are collinear with (0,0) and (4,4) so they are included.
In the second case, all points except the interior ones are included in the hull.
