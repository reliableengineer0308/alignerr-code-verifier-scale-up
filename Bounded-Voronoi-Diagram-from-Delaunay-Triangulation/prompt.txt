Problem: Bounded Voronoi Diagram from Delaunay Triangulation

Description:
Given a set of points (sites) in a 2D plane, compute the Delaunay triangulation and then derive the bounded Voronoi diagram.

To handle unbounded Voronoi regions, we'll add a bounding box around all sites and compute the clipped Voronoi diagram.

Input:
- First line: N (number of sites)
- Next N lines: x y (coordinates of each site)

Output:
- First line: V (number of Voronoi vertices)
- Next V lines: x y (coordinates of each Voronoi vertex, rounded to 2 decimal places)
- Next line: E (number of Voronoi edges)  
- Next E lines: i j (edge between Voronoi vertices i and j, 0-indexed)

Constraints:
- 3 ≤ N ≤ 1000
- -10^6 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^6
- No three points are colinear

Algorithm Requirements:
- Compute Delaunay triangulation
- Add bounding box to handle unbounded regions
- Calculate circumcenters as Voronoi vertices
- Connect Voronoi vertices and clip edges to bounding box

Example:
Input:
4
0 0
4 0
4 4
0 4

Output:
5
2.00 2.00
2.00 0.00
4.00 2.00
2.00 4.00
0.00 2.00
4
0 1
0 2
0 3
0 4

Explanation:
- 4 points form a square
- Bounding box is added to clip unbounded regions
- Voronoi diagram has a center vertex and 4 boundary vertices
- Edges connect center to each boundary vertex
