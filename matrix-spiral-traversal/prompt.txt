Problem: Spiral Matrix Traversal

Description:
Implement a function spiral_order(matrix) that returns all elements of a 2D matrix in spiral order (clockwise), starting from the top-left corner.

Your task:
- Traverse the matrix in a spiral pattern: right → down → left → up → repeat
- Collect elements in the order they are visited
- Return a list of values in spiral order
- Handle edge cases: empty matrix, single row/column

Input:
- 2D list matrix where each row is a list of integers
- Matrix dimensions: 0 ≤ m ≤ 100, 0 ≤ n ≤ 100
- Element range: −10^3≤matrix[i][j]≤10^3

Output:
- List of integers representing elements in spiral order
- If matrix is empty, return empty list []

Examples:
Example 1:
Input: matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]

Example 2:
python
Input: matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3, 4],
  [5, 6, 7, 8],
  [9,10,11,12]
]
Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]

Example 3:
Input: matrix = [1, 2, 3]
Output: [1, 2, 3]  # Single row

Constraints:
0≤m,n≤100
Time complexity: O(m×n)
Space complexity: O(1) extra space (not counting output list)
Do not modify the input matrix
Handle all edge cases properly

Notes:
- Use layer-by-layer traversal approach
- Track current boundaries: top, bottom, left, right
- After processing each side, shrink the boundary
- Stop when boundaries cross
- Test with rectangular matrices too
