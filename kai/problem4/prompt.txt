Problem: Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). 
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Input:

First number: length of array (n)

Next n numbers: the array elements

Output:

Length of the longest increasing subsequence

Example 1:
Function: solve(arr)
Input: arr = [8, 10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Function: solve(arr)
Input: arr = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 5
