Problem: Food Delivery Network

FoodExpress is a food delivery company that operates in a city with multiple restaurants and customers. 
The city has a network of roads with traffic limitations. Each restaurant has a certain number of delivery drivers available, and each customer has a specific food demand.
Due to traffic regulations, some roads have capacity limits on how many deliveries can pass through per hour. 
Additionally, some roads are one-way streets. Your task is to determine the maximum number of deliveries that can be made from restaurants to customers within the next hour while respecting all road capacity constraints.

Problem Details
The city has:

n locations (numbered 0 to n-1)
r restaurants (with delivery drivers)
c customers (with food demands)
m roads with capacity constraints

Each restaurant has a certain number of drivers available, and each customer has a specific food demand. The goal is to maximize the total number of successful deliveries.

Input Format
n m r c
restaurant_info_1 restaurant_info_2 ... restaurant_info_r
customer_info_1 customer_info_2 ... customer_info_c
road_1_source road_1_dest road_1_capacity
road_2_source road_2_dest road_2_capacity
...

Where:

Restaurant info: location_id driver_count

Customer info: location_id demand_count

Constraints
2 ≤ n ≤ 200

1 ≤ m ≤ 2000

1 ≤ r ≤ 50

1 ≤ c ≤ 50

0 ≤ driver_count ≤ 100

0 ≤ demand_count ≤ 100

0 ≤ road_capacity ≤ 100

All location IDs are valid (0 ≤ id < n)

Output Format
A single integer: maximum number of deliveries that can be made.



Example 1:
Function: solve(data)
Input: data = [ 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 10, 1, 8, 0, 1, 15 ]
