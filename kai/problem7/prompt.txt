Problem: "Secret Message Decoder"

In the ancient kingdom of Codetopia, spies used a special encryption method to send secret messages. 
They would hide a secret pattern within a longer text by repeating it multiple times with slight variations. 
Your mission is to build a decoder that can find all occurrences of a secret pattern in intercepted messages and calculate their "influence score" - the total number of times the pattern appears.
However, the spies are clever - the pattern might appear in overlapping positions, and each occurrence counts separately!
Given a text string and a pattern string, find the total number of occurrences of the pattern in the text, including overlapping occurrences.

Input Format
The input will be provided as a single string containing:

First line: length of text (n)
Second line: length of pattern (m)
Third line: the text string (as space-separated integers representing characters)
Fourth line: the pattern string (as space-separated integers representing characters)

Output Format
A single integer representing the total number of pattern occurrences.

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 10,000,000
1 ≤ m ≤ 10,00,000
m ≤ n

Text and pattern consist of integers from 0 to 255 (ASCII range)

# Required API
```python
def solve(data):
    lines = data.strip().split('\n')
    n = int(lines[0])
    m = int(lines[1])
    text = list(map(int, lines[2].split()))
    pattern = list(map(int, lines[3].split()))

Example 1:
Function: solve(arr)
Input: arr = """20
3
1 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9
1 2 3"""
Output: 4


Example 2:
Function: solve(arr)
Input: arr = """10
2
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1"""
Output: 9
