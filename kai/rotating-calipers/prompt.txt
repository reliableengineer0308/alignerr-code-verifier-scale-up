Problem: Maximum Distance using Rotating Calipers

Description:
Given a set of points in a 2D plane, find the maximum Euclidean distance between any two points (the diameter of the set).
Use the rotating calipers algorithm on the convex hull for efficiency.

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases)
- For each test case:
  - First line: N (number of points)
  - Next N lines: x y (coordinates of each point)

Output:
- For each test case:
  - Print "Case #X: Y" where X is test case number, Y is the maximum squared distance
  - Print the two points that achieve this maximum distance

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10
- 2 ≤ N ≤ 100000
- -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9

Algorithm Requirements:
- Compute convex hull first
- Use rotating calipers to find antipodal points
- Handle collinear cases properly
- Output squared distance to avoid floating point issues

2 0

Output:
Case #1: 50

5 5
Case #2: 32
0 0
4 4

Explanation:
- First case: all points collinear, maximum distance between (0,0) and (5,5)
- Second case: maximum distance between (0,0) and (4,4) with squared distance 32
