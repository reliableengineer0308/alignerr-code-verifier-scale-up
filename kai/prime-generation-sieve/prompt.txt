Problem: Prime Number Generation with Sieve

Description:
Given an integer N, generate all prime numbers up to N using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm:
1. Create a boolean list of size N+1, initialize all as True
2. Mark 0 and 1 as False (not prime)
3. For each number p from 2 to sqrt(N):
   - If p is prime, mark all multiples of p as not prime
4. Collect all numbers that remain marked as True

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases, 1 ≤ T ≤ 10)
- For each test case:
  - N (2 ≤ N ≤ 10^6)

Output:
- For each test case:
  - Print all prime numbers up to N in increasing order, separated by spaces

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
2
20
50

Output:
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47

Explanation:
Case 1: Primes up to 20
Case 2: Primes up to 50

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10
- 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
