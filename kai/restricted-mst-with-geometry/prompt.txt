Problem: Minimum Cost to Connect All Points (with Forbidden Edge Pairs)

You are given n points in 2D space: points[i] = [xi, yi].

The cost to connect two points (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) is their Manhattan distance:
|xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.

However, you are also given a list of forbidden edge pairs: forbidden_edges[k] = (u, v) meaning you cannot directly connect point u and point v.

Your task:
Find the minimum total cost to connect all n points into a single connected component (i.e., a spanning tree), without using any forbidden edge.
If it’s impossible to connect all points under these constraints, return -1.
Function to implement:
python
def min_cost_connect_points(points: list[list[int]], forbidden_edges: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> int:

Input:
- points: List of [x, y] coordinates. 1 <= n <= 15. 0 <= xi, yi <= 1000
- forbidden_edges: List of (u, v) pairs (0-indexed). No duplicates. 0 <= u, v < n, u != v

Output:
Minimum total cost to connect all points without forbidden edges, or -1 if impossible

Examples:
Example 1:
points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]
forbidden_edges = [(1,4)]
→ Output: 20
Explanation: MST total cost is 20. The forbidden edge (1,4) is not used.

Example 2:
points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]
forbidden_edges = [(0,1), (1,2), (0,2)]
→ Output: -1
Explanation: All possible direct edges are forbidden. With 3 points, we need at least 2 edges → impossible.

Example 3:
points = [[0,0], [1,1]]
forbidden_edges = [(0,1)]
→ Output: -1
Explanation: Only one possible edge, but it's forbidden → can't connect.

Constraints:
1 <= len(points) <= 15
0 <= len(forbidden_edges) <= n*(n-1)/2
All coordinates are integers
You must form a single connected tree (no cycles, no disconnected parts)

Hints:
1. This is a Constrained MST problem.
2. Since n <= 15, you can consider bitmask DP or state-space search (e.g., Dijkstra over state: (connected_set, last_added)).
3. Alternatively: generate all possible spanning trees (via backtracking) that avoid forbidden edges, compute cost, pick minimum.
4. Use Manhattan distance for edge weights.
5. If the graph of allowed edges is disconnected → return -1.
6. Consider Prim’s or Kruskal’s algorithm, but skip forbidden edges.
