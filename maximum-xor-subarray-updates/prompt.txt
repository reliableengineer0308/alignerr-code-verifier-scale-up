Problem: Maximum XOR Subarray with Updates

Description:
You are given an array of integers and need to support two types of operations:
    UPDATE index value: Set the element at the specified index to the given value.
    QUERY left right: Find the maximum XOR value of any contiguous subarray within the range [left, right].
    The XOR of a contiguous subarray [i, j] is defined as A[i] ⊕ A[i+1] ⊕ ... ⊕ A[j].

Detailed Explanation of "Maximum XOR of any subarray in [l, r]":
For a given query "QUERY l r", we need to find the maximum value among all possible XORs of contiguous subarrays that lie completely within the range [l, r].

Input Format:
    The first line contains T (number of test cases).
    For each test case:
        The first line contains two integers N and Q (array size and number of operations).
        The second line contains N integers representing the initial array.
        The next Q lines each contain an operation:
        "UPDATE i x" meaning set A[i] = x
        "QUERY l r" meaning find the maximum XOR of any subarray in [l, r]

Output Format:
    For each test case:
    First line: "Case #X:" where X is the test case number (starting from 1).
    For each QUERY operation, output the maximum XOR value on a separate line.
Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 100,000
0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^9
All indices are 0-based: 0 ≤ i < N, 0 ≤ l ≤ r < N

Example 1:
Input:
1
5 4
1 2 3 4 5
QUERY 0 4
UPDATE 2 10
QUERY 0 4
QUERY 1 3

Output:
Case #1:
7
14
14

Explanation:
    First QUERY: max XOR is 7 (from [2,3]: 3⊕4=7)
    After UPDATE: [1,2,10,4,5]
    Second QUERY: max XOR is 11 (from [2,4]: 10⊕4⊕5=11)
    Third QUERY: max XOR is 14 (from [2,3]: 10⊕4=14)

Example 2:
Input:
1
4 4
5 5 5 5
QUERY 0 3
UPDATE 1 0
QUERY 0 3
QUERY 1 2

Output:
Case #1:
5
5
5

Explanation:
    Initial: [5,5,5,5], max XOR is 5 (single elements)
    After UPDATE: [5,0,5,5], max XOR is 5 (single elements)
    QUERY [1,2]: max XOR is 5 (from [2,2])

Example 3:
Input:
1
3 4
1000000000 0 1000000000
QUERY 0 2
UPDATE 1 1000000000
QUERY 0 2
QUERY 1 1

Output:
Case #1:
1000000000
0
0

Explanation:
    First QUERY: max is 10^9 (single elements)
    After UPDATE: all elements are 10^9, so all XORs are 0
    QUERY [1,1]: single element XOR is 0

Implementation Requirements:
    Use binary trie for efficient maximum XOR queries
    Use segment tree to handle range queries and point updates
    Time complexity: O(N log N + Q log² N) per test case
