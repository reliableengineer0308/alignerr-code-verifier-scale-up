Problem: Partition Array into Two Subsets with Minimum Difference

Description:
Given an array of integers, partition it into two subsets such that the absolute difference 
between their sums is minimized. Return the minimum absolute difference.

Since n can be up to 40, use meet-in-the-middle technique.

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases, 1 ≤ T ≤ 10)
- For each test case:
  - First line: n (array size, 1 ≤ n ≤ 40)
  - Second line: n integers (array elements, -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9)

Output:
- For each test case:
  - Print "Case #X: Y" where X is test case number, Y is the minimum absolute difference

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
3
5
1 2 3 4 5
4
1 1 1 1
3
10 20 30

Output:
Case #1: 1
Case #2: 0
Case #3: 0

Explanation:
Case 1: Partition [1,2,3,4] and [5] gives difference |10-5| = 5; [1,3,5] and [2,4] gives |9-6| = 3; Optimal: [1,4] and [2,3,5] gives |5-10| = 5; Total sum=15, best partition sum=7 and 8, difference=1
Case 2: Partition [1,1] and [1,1] gives difference 0
Case 3: Partition [10,20] and [30] gives difference 0

Algorithm:
1. Split array into two halves
2. Generate all possible subset sums for each half
3. For each sum in first half, find the best matching sum in second half to minimize |sum1 + sum2 - (total_sum)/2|
4. The minimum difference is 2 * min_distance

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 40
- -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
