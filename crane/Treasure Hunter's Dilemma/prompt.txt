Treasure Hunter's Dilemma

You are a treasure hunter exploring ancient ruins. The ruins consist of n chambers arranged in a line. 
Each chamber contains a certain amount of gold, but there's a catch: if you take gold from two adjacent chambers, the ancient security system will trigger and you'll lose all your treasure!
Your goal is to maximize the amount of gold you can collect without triggering the security system.
Given an array chambers where chambers[i] represents the amount of gold in chamber i, find the maximum amount of gold you can collect without taking gold from two adjacent chambers.

Input Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 (number of chambers)
0 ≤ chambers[i] ≤ 10,000 (amount of gold in each chamber)

Input Format
The input will be a list of integers where:
The first number is n (number of chambers)
The next n numbers are the gold amounts in each chamber

Output Format
Return a single integer representing the maximum gold that can be collected.

# Required API
```python
def solve(data):
    n = data[0]
    chambers = data[1:1+n]


Example 1:
Function: solve(data):
Input: data = [5, 2, 7, 9, 3, 1]
Output: 12
Explanation : Optimal path: Take chambers at indices 2, 4, and 6 (values 2, 9, 1) Total: 2 + 9 + 1 = 12


Example 2:
Function: solve(data)
Input: data = [4, 5, 5, 5, 5]
Output: 10
