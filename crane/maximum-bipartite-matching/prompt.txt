Problem: Maximum Bipartite Matching

Description:
Given a bipartite graph with two sets U and V, find the maximum number of matching pairs.
A matching is a set of edges where no two edges share a common vertex.

Implement the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm for maximum bipartite matching.

Input Format:
- First line: T (number of test cases, 1 ≤ T ≤ 10)
- For each test case:
  - First line: m n e (number of vertices in set U, set V, and number of edges)
    - U: vertices 1 to m (1-indexed)
    - V: vertices 1 to n (1-indexed)
  - Next e lines: u v (edge from u in U to v in V)

Output Format:
- For each test case, output the maximum matching size

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 1000
- 0 ≤ e ≤ m × n
- 1 ≤ u ≤ m, 1 ≤ v ≤ n

Example 1 (Basic Bipartite Graph):
Input:
1
3 3 5
1 1
1 2
2 2
2 3
3 1

Output:
3

Explanation:
Maximum matching: 1-2, 2-3, 3-1 (all vertices can be matched)

Example 2 (Unbalanced Graph):
Input:
1
4 3 6
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 3
3 2
4 3

Output:
3

Explanation:
Maximum matching of size 3. One possible matching: 1-1, 2-3, 3-2
Vertex 4 in U cannot be matched as all its potential matches are already taken.

Example 3 (No Edges):
Input:
1
2 2 0

Output:
0

Explanation:
No edges, so no matching possible.

Example 4 (Complete Bipartite):

2 2
2 3
3 1
3 2
3 3

Output:
3

Explanation:
Complete bipartite graph K_{3,3}, maximum matching is 3.

4

Explanation:
First test case analysis:
U vertices: 1, 2, 3, 4
V vertices: 1, 2, 3, 4
Edges: 
  1: [1, 2]
  2: [3]
  3: [2, 4]
  4: [3]
Maximum matching: 1-1, 2-3, 3-4 (size 3)

Second test case analysis:
U vertices: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
V vertices: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Edges form a chain: 
  1: [1, 2]
  2: [2, 3]
  3: [3, 4]
  4: [4, 5]
  5: [] (no edges)
Maximum matching: 1-1, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5 (size 4)

Example 6 (Perfect Matching):
Input:

3 3
3 4
4 1
4 4

Output:
4

Explanation:
Perfect matching possible: 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-1

Algorithm Requirements:
- Implement Hopcroft-Karp algorithm for O(E√V) time complexity
- Use BFS for finding augmenting paths
- Use DFS for matching
- Handle multiple test cases efficiently

Important Notes:
- The graph is bipartite with sets U and V
- Vertices are 1-indexed in input, but you may use 0-indexed internally
- The algorithm should find the maximum cardinality matching
- Use the standard Hopcroft-Karp approach with level graph and DFS
- The algorithm works by repeatedly finding augmenting paths and increasing the matching
