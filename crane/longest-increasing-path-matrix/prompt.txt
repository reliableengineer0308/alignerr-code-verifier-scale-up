PROBLEM: LONGEST INCREASING PATH IN A MATRIX

LEVEL: HARD

DESCRIPTION:
Given an m×n matrix of integers, find the length of the longest strictly increasing path.

From each cell, you can move to any of the 4 adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) if the value in the adjacent cell is strictly greater than the current cell.

Return the length of the longest increasing path in the matrix.

INPUT:
- `matrix`: List[List[int]] where 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 200
- Each cell: -2^31 ≤ matrix[i][j] ≤ 2^31 - 1

OUTPUT:
- Integer: length of the longest strictly increasing path

EXAMPLES:

Example 1:
Input: matrix = 
[9,9,4],
[6,6,8],
[2,1,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest path is 1 → 2 → 6 → 9 (length = 4)

Example 2:
Input: matrix = 
[3,4,5],
[3,2,6],
[2,2,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 (length = 5)? Wait — actually 3→4→5→6 (length=4)

CONSTRAINTS:
- You must use DFS with memoization (top-down DP)
- Time: O(m×n), Space: O(m×n)
- No external libraries allowed

HINTS:
1. Use DFS from every cell
2. Memoize the longest path starting from each cell
3. Only move to strictly greater values
4. Directions: up, down, left, right
5. The answer is the maximum of all DFS results
