Problem: "Space Station Power Grid"
Problem Description
You are the chief engineer of a futuristic space station. 
The station has a circular power grid with N energy nodes. 
Each node has a certain power level, but there's a critical constraint: if you activate a node, you cannot activate its adjacent nodes (they're too close and would cause power surges).

Your mission is to select a set of non-adjacent nodes to maximize the total power output. Since the grid is circular, the first and last nodes are also considered adjacent.

Input Format:
The input is a list of integers where:
First integer: number of nodes (N)
Next N integers: power values of each node

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000
0 ≤ power values ≤ 10,000

Output:
Return the maximum total power achievable.



# Required API
```python
def solve(data):
    n = data[0]
    power = data[1:1 + n]


Example 1:
Function: solve(data):
Input: data = [4, 1, 2, 3, 1]
Output: 4


Example 2:
Function: solve(data)
Input: data = [3, 2, 3, 2]
Output: 3
