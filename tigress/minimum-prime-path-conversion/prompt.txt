Problem: Minimum Prime Path Conversion

Description:
You are given two 4-digit prime numbers A and B. Your task is to convert A to B by changing one digit at a time, 
such that every intermediate number formed during the conversion is also a 4-digit prime number. 
Find the minimum number of steps required to convert A to B. If it's impossible, return -1.

In each step, you can change exactly one digit of the current number to get another 4-digit prime number. 
The converted number must always remain a 4-digit number (1000 to 9999).

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases, 1 ≤ T ≤ 100)
- For each test case: 
  - One line with two 4-digit prime numbers A and B separated by space

Output:
- For each test case:
  - Print the minimum number of steps required to convert A to B
  - If conversion is impossible, print "Impossible"

Constraints:
- 1000 ≤ A, B ≤ 9999
- Both A and B are guaranteed to be prime numbers
- All intermediate numbers must be 4-digit primes

Example 1:
Input:
2
1033 8179
1373 8017

Output:
6
7

Explanation for Example 1:
For 1033 to 8179, one possible shortest path is:
1033 → 1733 → 3733 → 3739 → 3779 → 8779 → 8179
This takes 6 steps.

Example 2:
Input:
1
1009 1171

Output:
5

Explanation:
One possible path: 1009 → 1109 → 1103 → 1153 → 1163 → 1171

Example 3:
Input:
1
1033 1033

Output:
0

Explanation:
Source and destination are the same, no steps needed.

Example 4:
Input:
1
1009 9973

Output:
Impossible

Explanation:
No valid path exists between these two primes.

Algorithm Requirements:
- Precompute all 4-digit prime numbers first
- Build a graph where nodes are primes and edges connect primes that differ by exactly one digit
- Use BFS to find the shortest path from A to B
- Handle multiple test cases efficiently

Note:
- Two primes are connected if they differ by exactly one digit
- For example, 1033 and 1733 are connected (only first digit differs)
- But 1033 and 1039 are also connected (only last digit differs)
- All digits must be changed individually, you cannot change multiple digits at once
