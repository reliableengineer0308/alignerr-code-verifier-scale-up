Problem: Optimal Rectangle Packing

Description:
Implement an algorithm to pack a set of rectangles into a bounding container of minimal area. The goal is to find a non-overlapping arrangement of all rectangles such that the total bounding box has the smallest possible area.
This is a variant of the 2D Bin Packing Problem, known to be NP-hard.

Input:
* rectangles: List of tuples (w, h) representing width and height of each rectangle
* All rectangles must be axis-aligned (no rotation allowed)

Output:
- Tuple (min_area, placement) where:
 * min_area: Minimal area of bounding box
 * placement: List of tuples (x, y, w, h) indicating the position and size of each rectangle in the packing

Algorithm Requirements:
1. Approach Options (choose one or combine):
 * Greedy First-Fit Decreasing (FFD): Sort by area (descending), place each in first available position
 * Backtracking with Pruning: Try all positions, prune invalid/suboptimal branches
 * Skyline Heuristic: Maintain a “skyline” of available positions
2. Constraints:
 * Rectangles cannot overlap
 * No rotation (fixed orientation)
 * All coordinates ≥ 0
 * Minimize bounding box area (width × height)
3. Edge Cases:
 * Empty list → (0, )
 * Single rectangle → its area
 * Identical rectangles
 * Very tall vs very wide rectangles
4. Complexity Considerations:
 * Exact solution: exponential time (backtracking)
 * Heuristic: polynomial time with suboptimal results
5. Optimization Goals:
 * Prioritize compactness (min area)
 * Avoid excessive whitespace
 * Stable output (same input → same output)

Steps (Recommended: FFD + Backtracking):
1. Sort rectangles by area (descending)
2. Initialize empty grid and bounding box
3. For each rectangle:
 * Find all valid positions (no overlap)
 * Choose position that minimizes expansion of bounding box
4. Return final area and placement

Constraints:
* Pure Python (no external libraries)
* Handle up to 10 rectangles (exact solution)
* For >10 rectangles, use heuristic (FFD)
