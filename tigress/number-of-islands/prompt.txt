Problem: Number of Islands

Description:
Implement a function num_islands(grid) that returns the number of islands in a 2D binary grid. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Your task:
- Traverse the grid and count connected land regions ('1’s)
- Use either DFS or BFS to explore each island
- Mark visited cells to avoid double-counting
- Return the total number of distinct islands

Input:
- 2D list grid where each cell is either ‘1’ (land) or ‘0’ (water)
- Grid dimensions: 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 300
- It’s guaranteed that grid[i][j] ∈ {‘0’, ‘1’}

Output:
Integer: number of islands

Examples:
Example 1:
Input: grid = 
  1,1,1,1,0,
  1,1,0,1,0,
  1,1,0,0,0,
  0,0,0,0,0
Output: 1
Explanation: One connected island.

Example 2:
Input: grid =
  1,1,0,0,0,
  1,1,0,0,0,
  0,0,1,0,0,
  0,0,0,1,1
Output: 3
Explanation: Three separate islands.

Constraints:
1 ≤ m, n ≤ 300
Time complexity: O(m × n)
Space complexity: O(m × n) due to recursion/stack in worst case
Do not modify the input grid permanently (if required by use case)

Notes:
- Use DFS (recursive or iterative) or BFS for traversal
- When you find a ‘1’, start a traversal and mark all connected '1’s as visited
- Each complete traversal counts as one island
- Handle edge cases: empty grid, all water, all land
- Consider using a visited matrix or marking in-place (set ‘1’ → ‘0’ after visit)
