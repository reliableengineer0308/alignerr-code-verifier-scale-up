PROBLEM: MINIMUM COST TO CONNECT ALL POINTS

LEVEL: HARD

DESCRIPTION:
You are given an array `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane. 
Your goal is to connect all points with the minimum total cost, where the cost between two points is the Manhattan distance:
    cost(i, j) = |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|

Return the minimum cost to connect all points such that there is exactly one path between any two points (i.e., a spanning tree).

INPUT:
- `points`: List of [x, y] coordinates, 1 ≤ len(points) ≤ 1000
- Each coordinate: -10^6 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^6


OUTPUT:
- Integer: minimum total cost to connect all points

EXAMPLES:

Example 1:
Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]
Output: 20
Explanation: Optimal connection forms a minimum spanning tree with total cost 20.

Example 2:
Input: points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]
Output: 18

CONSTRAINTS:
- All points are distinct
- You must use Prim's algorithm (not Kruskal's)
- Time complexity: O(n²), Space: O(n)
- No external libraries allowed

HINTS:
1. Use Prim's algorithm with a priority queue (heap) or array-based selection
2. Start from any node (e.g., index 0)
3. Maintain an array of minimum distances to the MST
4. Update distances as you add nodes
5. Manhattan distance: |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|
