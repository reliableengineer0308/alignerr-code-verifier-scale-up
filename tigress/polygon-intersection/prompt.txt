Problem: Polygon Intersection Area

Description:
Given two convex polygons, compute the area of their intersection.
The polygons are given in counter-clockwise order.

Input:
- First line: N (number of vertices in polygon A)
- Next N lines: x y (vertices of polygon A)
- Next line: M (number of vertices in polygon B)  
- Next M lines: x y (vertices of polygon B)

Output:
- Area of intersection rounded to 2 decimal places

Constraints:
- 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 1000
- -10^6 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^6
- Both polygons are convex and given in counter-clockwise order

Algorithm Requirements:
- Use polygon clipping algorithm (Sutherland-Hodgman or Weiler-Atherton)
- Handle all intersection cases (disjoint, contained, overlapping)
- Compute area using shoelace formula

Example:
Input:
4
0 0
4 0
4 4
0 4
4
1 1
5 1
5 5
1 5

Output:
9.00

Explanation:
- Polygon A: square from (0,0) to (4,4), area = 16
- Polygon B: square from (1,1) to (5,5), area = 16  
- Intersection: square from (1,1) to (4,4), area = 9
