Problem: Mobius Function

Description:
The Mobius function μ(n) is defined as:
- μ(1) = 1
- μ(n) = 1 if n is a product of an even number of distinct primes
- μ(n) = -1 if n is a product of an odd number of distinct primes  
- μ(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor

Given an integer N, compute μ(N).

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases, 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000)
- For each test case:
  - N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6)

Output:
- For each test case:
  - Print μ(N)

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
6
1
2
4
6
12
30

Output:
1
-1
0
1
0
-1

Explanation:
Case 1: μ(1) = 1
Case 2: 2 is prime → μ(2) = -1
Case 3: 4 = 2^2 → has squared prime factor → μ(4) = 0
Case 4: 6 = 2*3 → product of 2 distinct primes (even) → μ(6) = 1
Case 5: 12 = 2^2*3 → has squared prime factor → μ(12) = 0
Case 6: 30 = 2*3*5 → product of 3 distinct primes (odd) → μ(30) = -1

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
