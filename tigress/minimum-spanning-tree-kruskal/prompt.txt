Problem: Minimum Spanning Tree using Kruskal's Algorithm

Description:
Given a connected, undirected, and weighted graph, find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Kruskal's algorithm.
The MST is a subset of edges that connects all vertices together without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

Input Format:
- First line: T (number of test cases, 1 ≤ T ≤ 10)
- For each test case:
  - First line: V E (number of vertices and edges)
    - Vertices are labeled from 0 to V-1 (0-indexed)
  - Next E lines: u v w (edge from u to v with weight w)

Output Format:
- For each test case, output the total weight of the MST
- If the graph is not connected, output "Disconnected Graph"

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ V ≤ 1000
- 0 ≤ E ≤ V×(V-1)/2
- 1 ≤ w ≤ 1000 (edge weights are positive integers)
- The graph may not be connected

Example 1 (Simple Connected Graph):
Input:
1
4 5
0 1 10
0 2 6
0 3 5
1 3 15
2 3 4

Output:
19

Explanation:
The MST includes edges: 2-3 (4), 0-3 (5), 0-1 (10)
Total weight = 4 + 5 + 10 = 19

Example 2 (Disconnected Graph):
Input:
1
5 3
0 1 5
1 2 3
3 4 2

Output:
Disconnected Graph

Explanation:
The graph has two disconnected components: {0,1,2} and {3,4}
Cannot form a spanning tree that connects all vertices.

Example 3 (Single Vertex):
Input:
1
1 0

Output:
0

Explanation:
A graph with only one vertex has an MST with weight 0 (no edges needed).

Example 4 (Complete Graph):
Input:
1
4 6
0 1 1
0 2 2
0 3 3
1 2 4
1 3 5
2 3 6

Output:
6

Explanation:
MST edges: 0-1 (1), 0-2 (2), 0-3 (3)
Total weight = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

Example 5 (Multiple Test Cases):
Input:
2
3 3
0 1 5
1 2 3
0 2 1
4 4
0 1 2
1 2 3
2 3 1
0 3 4

Output:
4
6

Explanation:
First test case: MST edges 0-2 (1), 1-2 (3) → total 4
Second test case: MST edges 2-3 (1), 0-1 (2), 1-2 (3) → total 6

Example 6 (Complex Graph with Multiple Components):
Input:
1
6 7
0 1 4
0 2 3
1 2 1
1 3 2
2 3 4
3 4 2
4 5 3

Output:
11

Explanation:
MST edges: 1-2 (1), 1-3 (2), 3-4 (2), 0-2 (3), 4-5 (3)
Total weight = 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 11

Algorithm Requirements:
- Implement Kruskal's algorithm with Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)
- Sort edges by weight in non-decreasing order
- Use path compression and union by rank for efficient Union-Find operations
- Check if the graph is connected by verifying if all vertices are in the same set

Important Notes:
- The graph may have multiple edges between the same vertices
- The graph may not be connected
- Handle cases where V = 0 or E = 0 appropriately
- The algorithm should be efficient for the given constraints
- Output the total MST weight as integer

Implementation Steps:
1. For each test case, read V and E
2. Create a list of edges and sort by weight
3. Initialize Union-Find data structure
4. Process edges in sorted order:
   - If adding the edge doesn't create a cycle, add it to MST
5. Check if MST has exactly V-1 edges
   - If yes, output total weight
