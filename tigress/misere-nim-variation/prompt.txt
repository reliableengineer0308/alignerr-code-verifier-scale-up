Problem: Misère Nim Variation

Description:
In this Misère Nim variation, there are multiple piles of stones.
On each turn, a player must remove at least one stone from exactly one pile.
The player who takes the last stone **loses** (misère condition).

However, there's a twist: some piles are "special" piles where you can only remove 
1, 2, or 3 stones (like in take-away game), while normal piles have no restrictions.

Determine if the first player has a winning strategy.

Game Rules:
1. Normal piles: Can remove any number of stones (1 to all)
2. Special piles: Can only remove 1, 2, or 3 stones
3. Misère condition: Player who takes the last stone loses

Mathematical Background:
- For normal piles in misère Nim: XOR strategy works like normal Nim, except when all piles are size 1
- For special piles: Grundy number = stones % 4 (for take-away 1,2,3)
- Combine using XOR of all Grundy numbers

Winning Condition:
- If XOR of all Grundy numbers ≠ 0: First player wins
- If XOR of all Grundy numbers = 0: Second player wins

Special cases in misère:
- If all piles are normal and all have size 1: XOR would be 0 but first player wins (takes all but one)
- If there's at least one pile with >1 stones: use normal XOR strategy

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases)
- For each test case:
  - First line: N (number of piles)
  - Next N lines: Each line contains "type size" where:
    - "normal k" for normal pile with k stones
    - "special k" for special pile with k stones

Output:
- For each test case: "First" or "Second"

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^6

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
2
2
normal 3
special 2
1
special 1

Output:
First
Second

Explanation:
First case: 
- Normal pile(3): In misère, Grundy = 3 (since not all piles are 1)
- Special pile(2): Grundy = 2 % 4 = 2
- XOR = 3 ⊕ 2 = 1 ≠ 0 → First wins

Second case:
- Special pile(1): Player must take the last stone and loses
- First player loses → Second wins

Example 2:
Input:
1
3
normal 1
normal 1
special 1

Output:
First

Explanation:
All piles have size 1, but there are special piles.
In misère Nim with all piles size 1:
- If number of piles is odd: First player loses (normal misère)
- But here we have special piles mixed, need careful calculation
Actually, with special piles, the strategy changes.

After analysis:
normal(1): Grundy = 1
normal(1): Grundy = 1  
special(1): Grundy = 1
XOR = 1 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 1 = 1 ≠ 0 → First wins

Example 3:
Input:
1
2
normal 2
special 4

Output:
First

Explanation:
normal(2): Grundy = 2
special(4): Grundy = 4 % 4 = 0
XOR = 2 ⊕ 0 = 2 ≠ 0 → First wins
