Problem: Counting Numbers with Exactly K Prime Factors

Description:
Given integers N and K, count how many numbers between 1 and N (inclusive) have exactly K distinct prime factors.

We can solve this using Mobius inversion and inclusion-exclusion principle.

Let f(n, k) = count of numbers ≤ n with exactly k distinct prime factors.

We can compute this using:
f(n, k) = Σ_{d} μ(d) * C(ω(d), k) * floor(n/d)
where ω(d) is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

Alternatively, we can use dynamic programming with prime factorization.

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases, 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000)
- For each test case:
  - N K (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ K ≤ 10)

Output:
- For each test case:
  - Print the count of numbers between 1 and N with exactly K distinct prime factors

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
5
10 1
10 2
100 2
1000 3
1000000 4

Output:
4
2
34
132
861

Explanation:
Case 1: Numbers with exactly 1 prime factor up to 10: 2,3,5,7 → 4 numbers
Case 2: Numbers with exactly 2 prime factors up to 10: 6,10 → 2 numbers  
Case 3: 34 numbers between 1-100 with exactly 2 prime factors
Case 4: 132 numbers between 1-1000 with exactly 3 prime factors
Case 5: 861 numbers between 1-1000000 with exactly 4 prime factors

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
- 0 ≤ K ≤ 10
