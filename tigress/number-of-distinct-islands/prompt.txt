PROBLEM: NUMBER OF DISTINCT ISLANDS (BY SHAPE)

LEVEL: HARD

DESCRIPTION:
Given a 2D binary matrix `grid` of 0s (water) and 1s (land), count the number of *distinct* islands.

Two islands are considered the same (not distinct) if one can be translated (shifted) to equal the other — i.e., they have the same shape. Rotation and reflection are NOT allowed.

Return the number of distinct island shapes.

INPUT:
- `grid`: List[List[int]] where 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 50
- Each cell is 0 or 1

OUTPUT:
- Integer: number of distinct island shapes

EXAMPLES:

Example 1:
Input:
grid = [
  [1,1,0,0,0],
  [1,1,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,1,1],
  [0,0,0,1,1]
]
Output: 1
Explanation: Two islands, both 2×2 squares → same shape → count = 1

Example 2:
Input:
grid = [
  [1,1,0,1,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,1,0,1,1]
]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three distinct shapes exist.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Use DFS or BFS to explore each island
- Normalize island coordinates to a canonical form (e.g., relative to top-left corner)
- Use a set to store unique shapes
- Time: O(m×n), Space: O(m×n)
- No external libraries (like numpy) allowed

HINTS:
1. For each unvisited land cell, start DFS
2. Record the path of relative coordinates (e.g., from the first cell)
3. Sort or normalize the relative coordinates into a hashable form
4. Add the shape signature to a set
5. Return the size of the set
