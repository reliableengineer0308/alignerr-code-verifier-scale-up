Problem: Particle Swarm Optimization for Rastrigin Function

Description:
Minimize the Rastrigin function using Particle Swarm Optimization.
Rastrigin function: f(x) = A*n + Σ[x_i² - A*cos(2πx_i)] for i=1 to n, where A=10
Search space: x_i ∈ [-5.12, 5.12]

Input:
- First line: dimensions particles iterations
- Next line: w c1 c2 (inertia weight, cognitive parameter, social parameter)

Output:
- First line: best_position (comma-separated values rounded to 6 decimal places)
- Second line: best_fitness (rounded to 6 decimal places)
- Third line: convergence (comma-separated best fitness per iteration)

Constraints:
- 2 ≤ dimensions ≤ 10
- 20 ≤ particles ≤ 100
- 100 ≤ iterations ≤ 2000
- 0.4 ≤ w ≤ 0.9
- 1.5 ≤ c1, c2 ≤ 2.5

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
2 50 500
0.7 2.0 2.0

Output:
0.000000,0.000000
0.000000
9.234,8.156,7.023,...,0.000

Example 2:
Input:
3 30 300
0.8 1.8 2.2

Output:
0.000000,0.000000,0.000000
0.000000
12.456,10.234,8.567,...,0.000

Implementation Approach:
1. Initialize particles with random positions and velocities
2. Update velocity: v = w*v + c1*r1*(pbest - x) + c2*r2*(gbest - x)
3. Update position: x = x + v
4. Clamp positions to search space [-5.12, 5.12]
5. Track personal best and global best positions
6. The global minimum is at (0,0,...,0) with value 0
