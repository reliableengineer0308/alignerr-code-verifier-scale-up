Problem: Maximum Non-Adjacent Subsequence Sum
Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum of a subsequence where no two elements are adjacent in the original array. 
You need to find the maximum possible sum of such a subsequence.

Input:
A list of integers arr (1 ≤ length ≤ 10^5, -1000 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1000)

Output:

Return the maximum sum of a non-adjacent subsequence

Example 1:
Function: solve(arr)
Input: arr = [3, 2, 7, 10]
Output: 13

Example 2:
Function: solve(arr)
Input: arr = [3, 2, 5, 10, 7]
Output: 15
