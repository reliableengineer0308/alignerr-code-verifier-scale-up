Problem: Task Scheduling with Minimum Resources
Problem Statement:
You are given n tasks, each with a start time and duration. 
Each task requires a dedicated resource to execute. 
Find the minimum number of resources needed so that all tasks can be executed without overlapping on the same resource.

Input Format:
The input is a list of integers. 
The first integer is the number of tasks n. 
Then for each task, there are 2 integers: start time and duration.

Output:
The minimum number of resources required


Example 1:
Function: solve(arr)
Input: arr = [4, 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 2, 6, 4]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Function: solve(arr)
Input: arr = [1, 1, 5]
Output: 1
