Problem Title: Course Schedule (Graph Topological Sort)

Description:
You are tasked with determining whether it’s possible to complete all courses given a list of prerequisites. Each course has a unique ID from 0 to numCourses - 1. A prerequisite pair [ai, bi] means you must take course bi before course ai.

Your goal is to return True if all courses can be finished, or False if there’s a cycle (making completion impossible).

Key Requirements:
* Model the problem as a directed graph using adjacency list representation
* Detect cycles using DFS with 3-state marking (unvisited, visiting, visited)
* Handle edge cases (empty prerequisites, self-loops, disconnected components)
* Optimize for O(V + E) time and space complexity
* Return a boolean result (no need to output the order)

Input Format:
* numCourses: integer (1 ≤ numCourses ≤ 2000)
* prerequisites: list of pairs [[ai, bi], ...] where 0 ≤ ai, bi < numCourses

Output Format:
* Boolean: True if all courses can be completed, False otherwise

Examples:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]] → Output: True
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]] → Output: False
Input: numCourses = 3, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0]] → Output: True
Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = [] → Output: True

Why This Problem?
* Teaches core graph concepts (directed graphs, adjacency lists, cycle detection)
* Models real-world scenarios (course planning, dependency resolution)
* Demonstrates DFS optimization with state tracking
* Common in technical interviews
* Builds foundation for topological sorting

Expected Solution Approach:
1. Build adjacency list from prerequisites
2. Use DFS with 3-state marking:
	0: unvisited
	1: currently visiting (in recursion stack)
	2: fully visited
3. If you encounter a node marked 1 during DFS, a cycle exists
4. Return False immediately if cycle found, else True after processing all nodes

Constraints:
- Must run in O(V + E) time
- Must use O(V + E) space for graph storage
- Handle all edge cases explicitly
