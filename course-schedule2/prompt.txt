Problem: Course Schedule

## Problem Description
There are a total of numCourses courses you need to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.

You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [a, b] indicates that 
you must take course b first if you want to take course a (b → a).

Return true if you can finish all courses (no cycles in dependency graph), otherwise return false.

## Input Format
- First line: T (number of test cases)
- For each test case:
  - First line: numCourses
  - Second line: number of prerequisites
  - Next lines: prerequisite pairs [a, b] meaning b → a

## Output Format
- For each test case: "true" if possible, "false" otherwise

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ numCourses ≤ 2000
- 0 ≤ prerequisites ≤ 5000

## Example 1: No Cycle
### Input
1
4
4
1 0
2 0
3 1
3 2

### Output
true

### Explanation
Dependency graph:
0 → 1 → 3
0 → 2 → 3
No cycles, so all courses can be finished.

## Example 2: With Cycle
### Input
1
2
2
1 0
0 1

### Output
false

### Explanation
Dependency graph has cycle: 0 → 1 → 0
Cannot finish courses.

## Example 3: No Prerequisites
### Input
1
3
0

### Output
true

### Explanation
No dependencies, can take courses in any order.

## Algorithm Requirements
- Use topological sort (Kahn's algorithm) or DFS cycle detection
- Build adjacency list and indegree array
- Time complexity: O(V + E)
