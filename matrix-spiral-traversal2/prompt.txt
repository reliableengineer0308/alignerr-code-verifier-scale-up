Problem: Spiral Matrix Traversal

Implement a function that traverses an m × n matrix in spiral (clockwise) order and returns the elements as a list.

Function to implement:
def spiral_order(matrix):

Input:
- A 2D list `matrix` representing an m × n matrix
- 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 100
- Matrix elements are integers in range [-100, 100]
- The matrix is guaranteed to be non-empty

Output:
- A list containing the elements of the matrix traversed in clockwise spiral order

Spiral traversal rules:
1. Start from the top-left corner (0,0)
2. Move right → down → left → up, repeating this pattern
3. After completing a full loop, shrink the boundary and continue
4. Stop when all elements have been visited

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1, 2, 3],
                 [4, 5, 6],
                 [7, 8, 9]]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[1,  2,  3,  4],
                 [5,  6,  7,  8],
                 [9, 10, 11, 12]]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 11, 10, 9, 5, 6, 7]

Example 3 (single column):
Input: matrix = [[1],
                 [2],
                 [3],
                 [4]]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Example 4 (single row):
Input: matrix = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Constraints:
- Do not modify the input matrix
- Time complexity: O(m × n)
- Space complexity: O(1) excluding the output list
- Handle edge cases: single row, single column, rectangular, square

Hints:
- Use four boundary pointers: top, bottom, left, right
- After each direction, update the corresponding boundary
- Stop when boundaries cross
- Process directions: right → down → left → up
