The Chrono-Energy Network
Problem Description
In the year 2150, humanity has developed a network of temporal energy conduits that connect different time periods. 
Each conduit transfers chrono-energy between two specific years, but the energy transfer efficiency depends on the temporal distance between them.
As the chief temporal engineer, your mission is to find the most efficient path for chrono-energy to travel from a starting year to a target year through this network.

Problem Statement
You are given:
A list of temporal nodes (years) labeled from 0 to N-1
A list of temporal conduits (edges) between these nodes, each with a positive energy cost
A starting node S and target node T
Your task is to find the minimum total energy cost required to transfer chrono-energy from node S to node T through the network of temporal conduits.

Input Format
The first line contains four integers:
N: number of temporal nodes (2 ≤ N ≤ 100,000)
M: number of temporal conduits (1 ≤ M ≤ 200,000)
S: starting node (0 ≤ S < N)
T: target node (0 ≤ T < N)

The next M lines each contain three integers:
u: source node (0 ≤ u < N)
v: target node (0 ≤ v < N)
w: energy cost (1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9)

Output Format
Output a single integer: the minimum total energy cost from node S to node T. If no path exists, output -1.

Constraints
The graph may contain multiple edges between the same nodes
The graph is undirected
No self-loops
Time limit: 2 seconds
Memory limit: 256 MB
