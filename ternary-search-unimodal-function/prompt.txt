Problem: Find Maximum of Unimodal Function using Ternary Search

Description:
You are given a unimodal function f(x) that first increases to a maximum and then decreases. 
The function is defined on a continuous range [left, right]. Your task is to find the value of x 
that maximizes f(x) within the given range with precision up to 1e-7.

The function f(x) is defined as: f(x) = -ax² + bx + c, where a > 0 (ensuring it's unimodal)

However, the function parameters are not given directly. Instead, you are given evaluation points
and must use ternary search to find the maximum.

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases, 1 ≤ T ≤ 100)
- For each test case:
  - First line: left right (search range boundaries, -1000 ≤ left < right ≤ 1000)
  - Second line: a b c (function parameters, 0.1 ≤ a ≤ 100, -1000 ≤ b, c ≤ 1000)

Output:
- For each test case:
  - Print "Case #X: Y" where X is test case number, Y is the x value that maximizes f(x)
  - The answer should have absolute error less than 1e-6

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
3
0.0 10.0
1.0 0.0 0.0
-5.0 5.0
2.0 8.0 1.0
1.0 20.0
0.5 -10.0 100.0

Output:
Case #1: 0.000000
Case #2: 2.000000
Case #3: 10.000000

Explanation:
Case 1: f(x) = -1.0x², maximum at x = 0.0
Case 2: f(x) = -2.0x² + 8.0x + 1.0, derivative f'(x) = -4x + 8 = 0 → x = 2.0
Case 3: f(x) = -0.5x² - 10x + 100, derivative f'(x) = -x - 10 = 0 → x = -10, but since -10 is outside [1,20], maximum at boundary x = 1.0

Algorithm:
Use ternary search to find the maximum of unimodal function:
1. While (right - left) > precision:
2.   mid1 = left + (right - left) / 3
3.   mid2 = right - (right - left) / 3
4.   If f(mid1) < f(mid2): left = mid1
5.   Else: right = mid2

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- -1000 ≤ left < right ≤ 1000
- 0.1 ≤ a ≤ 100, -1000 ≤ b, c ≤ 1000
- Precision requirement: 1e-7
