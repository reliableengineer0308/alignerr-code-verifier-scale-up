Problem: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Description:
Implement a function length_of_longest_substring(s) that returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Your task:
- Find the longest contiguous substring with all unique characters
- Return its length (integer)
- Use sliding window technique with hash set for O(n) time

Input:
- String s with 0 ≤ len(s) ≤ 5 * 10⁴
- Characters are ASCII (can include letters, digits, symbols)

Output:
Integer: length of longest substring with no repeating chars

Examples:
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: "abc" is longest (length 3)

Example 2:
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: Only "b" possible

Example 3:
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: "wke" is longest (not "pwke! due to repeating 'w')

Constraints:
0 ≤ len(s) ≤ 50000
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(min(m, n)) where m = charset size

Notes:
- Use two pointers (left, right) and a set to track current window
- Expand right while no duplicates
- When duplicate found, shrink window from left until duplicate removed
- Update max length at each step
