Problem: Polygon Point Location with Dynamic Updates

Description:
You are given a simple polygon (no self-intersections) and need to support two types of operations:
1. Query whether a point is inside, outside, or on the boundary of the polygon
2. Update the polygon by moving one of its vertices to a new position

The polygon is given as a list of vertices in counter-clockwise order.

Input:
- First line: N (number of vertices in initial polygon)
- Next N lines: x y (coordinates of each vertex in counter-clockwise order)
- Next line: Q (number of operations)
- Next Q lines, each containing one of:
  - "QUERY x y" - Check if point (x,y) is inside, outside, or on the polygon
  - "UPDATE i x y" - Move vertex i (0-indexed) to new position (x,y)

Output:
- For each QUERY operation, output one of:
  - "INSIDE"
  - "OUTSIDE" 
  - "BOUNDARY"

Constraints:
- 3 ≤ N ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10000
- -10^6 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^6
- Polygon is simple (no self-intersections)
- After each update, the polygon remains simple

Algorithm Requirements:
- Use ray casting algorithm for point location
- Handle dynamic updates efficiently by maintaining polygon structure
- Check for point on boundary cases accurately

Example:
Input:
4
0 0
4 0
4 4
0 4
7
QUERY 2 2
QUERY 5 5
QUERY 2 0
UPDATE 1 6 0
QUERY 3 2
QUERY 5 1
QUERY 2 0

Output:
INSIDE
OUTSIDE
BOUNDARY
INSIDE
INSIDE
BOUNDARY

Explanation:
- Initially: square from (0,0) to (4,4)
- (2,2) is inside, (5,5) is outside, (2,0) is on boundary
- After updating vertex 1 from (4,0) to (6,0): polygon becomes rectangle (0,0)-(6,0)-(4,4)-(0,4)
- (3,2) is inside the new polygon, (5,1) is inside, (2,0) is still on boundary
