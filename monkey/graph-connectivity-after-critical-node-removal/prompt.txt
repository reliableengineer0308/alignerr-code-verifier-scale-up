Problem: Graph Connectivity After Removing Critical Nodes

Description:
You are given an undirected, unweighted graph. Your task is to identify critical nodes (also known as articulation points) — nodes whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.
After identifying all critical nodes, simulate their removal one by one and compute the number of connected components in the resulting graph for each removal.

Goal: Return a list of (critical_node, component_count) pairs sorted by node ID.

Requirements:
- Implement an efficient algorithm to find articulation points using DFS with discovery times and low values.
- For each critical node:
 * Temporarily remove it from the graph
 * Compute the number of connected components in the remaining graph
 * Record the result
- Return results sorted by node ID
- Handle edge cases: no critical nodes, fully connected graphs, isolated nodes

Input:
* n: number of nodes (labeled 0 to n-1)
* edges: list of undirected edges as tuples (u, v)

Output:
* List of tuples [(node, component_count), ...] for all critical nodes
* Sorted by node in ascending order
* If no critical nodes exist → return empty list []

Constraints:
* 1≤n≤1000
* 0≤len(edges)≤n(n−1)/2
​* Graph may be disconnected initially
* No self-loops or duplicate edges

Example:
n = 5
edges = [(0,1), (1,2), (2,0), (1,3), (3,4)]
* Critical nodes: 1, 3 (removing either increases components)
* Remove 1: graph splits into components {0,2}, {3,4} → 2 components
* Remove 3: graph splits into {0,1,2}, {4} → 2 components
* Output: [(1, 2), (3, 2)]

Algorithm Steps:
1. Use DFS to find all articulation points
2. For each articulation point:
 * Create a copy of the graph without that node
 * Run DFS/BFS to count connected components
 * Store result
3. Sort results by node ID

Notes:
- Use adjacency list representation
- Efficiently handle node removal (don’t rebuild graph from scratch each time)
- Consider corner cases:
 * Single node
 * No edges
 * All nodes are critical
 * No critical nodes
