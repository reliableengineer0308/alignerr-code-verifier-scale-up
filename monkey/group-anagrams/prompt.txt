Problem: Group Anagrams

Description:
Implement a function group_anagrams(strs) that groups anagrams from a list of strings. An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word.

Your task:
- Group all strings that are anagrams of each other
- Return a list of lists, where each sublist contains anagrams
- Order within groups doesn’t matter, but all anagrams must be grouped
- Use hash map with sorted string as key

Input:
- List strs of strings (1 ≤ len(strs) ≤ 10⁴)
- Each string length: 0 ≤ len(str) ≤ 100
- All strings contain lowercase English letters

Output:
List of lists: each sublist is a group of anagrams

Examples:
Example 1:
Input: strs = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
Output: [["eat","tea","ate"], ["tan","nat"], ["bat"]]

Example 2:
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]

Example 3:
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]

Constraints:
1 ≤ len(strs) ≤ 10⁴
0 ≤ len(str[i]) ≤ 100
Time complexity: O(n * k * log k) where k = max string length
Space complexity: O(n * k)

Notes:
- Use dictionary where key = sorted string, value = list of anagrams
- For each string, sort its characters to get canonical form
- Group strings with same canonical form
- Handle empty strings and single characters
