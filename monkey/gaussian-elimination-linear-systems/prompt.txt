Problem: Gaussian Elimination with Partial Pivoting

Description:
Solve a system of linear equations Ax = b using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting.
Handle cases with unique solution, no solution, or infinite solutions.

Input:
- First line: n (number of equations/variables)
- Next n lines: n+1 space-separated numbers (the augmented matrix [A|b])
- Matrix A is n×n, vector b is n×1

Output:
- If unique solution: "Solution" followed by n lines with variable values (rounded to 6 decimal places)
- If no solution: "No solution"
- If infinite solutions: "Infinite solutions"

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- -1000 ≤ matrix elements ≤ 1000

Examples:

Example 1 (Unique solution):
Input:
3
2 1 -1 8
-3 -1 2 -11
-2 1 2 -3

Output:
Solution
2.000000
3.000000
-1.000000

Explanation:
The system:
2x + y - z = 8
-3x - y + 2z = -11
-2x + y + 2z = -3
Has solution: x=2, y=3, z=-1

Example 2 (No solution):
Input:
2
1 1 1
1 1 2

Output:
No solution

Explanation:
x + y = 1
x + y = 2
These equations are inconsistent.

Example 3 (Infinite solutions):
Input:
2
1 1 1
2 2 2

Output:
Infinite solutions

Explanation:
The second equation is a multiple of the first.

Implementation Requirements:
1. Use Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting
2. Handle zero pivots by row swapping
3. Detect inconsistent systems (no solution)
4. Detect systems with infinite solutions
5. Output solutions with 6 decimal places
