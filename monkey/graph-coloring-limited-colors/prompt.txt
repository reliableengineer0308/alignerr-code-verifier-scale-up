Problem: Graph Coloring with Limited Colors

Description:
Implement an algorithm to determine whether a given undirected graph can be colored using at most k colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
This is the classic Graph Coloring Problem (a known NP-Complete problem).

Input:
* graph: Dictionary representing adjacency list (vertices → list of neighbors)
* k: Integer, maximum number of colors allowed (1≤k≤10)

Output:
* Boolean: True if the graph can be colored with ≤ k colors, False otherwise

Algorithm Requirements:
1. Backtracking Approach:
 * Assign colors to vertices one by one.
 * Before assigning a color, check if it conflicts with already-colored neighbors.
 * If no valid color exists for a vertex, backtrack.
2. Color Validation:
 * For each vertex, try colors from 0 to k-1.
 * A color is valid if no adjacent vertex has the same color.
3. Optimization:
 * Use a colors array where colors[i] = color of vertex i.
 * Initialize all colors as -1 (unassigned).
4. Edge Cases:
 * Empty graph → True (trivially colorable)
 * Single vertex → True for any k ≥ 1
 * Disconnected components
 * Complete graphs (e.g., triangles, cliques)

Steps:
1. If k == 0: return False (unless graph is empty).
2. If k >= number of vertices: always True (each vertex can have unique color).
3. Use backtracking to assign colors:
 * Pick an uncolored vertex.
 * Try each color from 0 to k-1.
 * Check if color conflicts with neighbors.
 * Recurse; if fails, backtrack.
4. Return True if all vertices are colored successfully.

Complexity:
* Time: O(k^V) in worst case (backtracking)
 * Space: O(V+E) (for graph and color tracking)

Constraints:
* Pure Python (no external libraries).
* Graphs with up to 15 vertices (due to NP-completeness).
* Vertices are labeled as integers starting from 0.
