Problem: Greedy Coin Change Problem

Description:
Given a set of coin denominations (sorted in ascending order) and a target amount, find the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount using a greedy approach. The greedy strategy selects the largest denomination coin that does not exceed the remaining amount at each step.
Note: The greedy solution is not always optimal for arbitrary coin systems (e.g., coins [1, 3, 4] and amount 6 → greedy gives 4+1+1=3 coins, but optimal is 3+3=2 coins). This problem assumes the coin system is canonical (like real-world currencies) where greedy works.

Input:
* coins: List of positive integers representing coin denominations (sorted in ascending order)
* amount: Non-negative integer (target amount to make)

Output:
* Integer: Minimum number of coins needed using greedy selection
* Return -1 if the amount cannot be formed (even though greedy might fail, we return -1 only if no combination exists)

Greedy Strategy:
1. Start with the largest coin ≤ remaining amount.
2. Use as many of that coin as possible.
3. Subtract the total value from the amount.
4. Repeat with the next largest coin until amount = 0.

Requirements:
1. Assume coins[0] == 1 (so any amount can be formed).
2. Coins are unique and sorted: coins[0] < coins[1] < ... < coins[n-1].
3. Handle edge cases:
 * amount == 0 → return 0
 * Invalid inputs → handle gracefully
4. Time complexity: O(n) where n = number of coin types.

Algorithm Hints:
1. Iterate from the largest coin down to smallest.
2. For each coin:
 * Count how many times it fits: count = amount // coin
 * Add count to total coins
 * Reduce amount -= count * coin
3. If amount == 0, return total coins. Else, return -1.

Examples:
coins = [1, 5, 10, 25], amount = 67
→ Output: 6  # 2×25 + 1×10 + 1×5 + 2×1 = 6 coins

coins = [1, 3, 4], amount = 6  
→ Output: 3  # Greedy: 4+1+1 (3 coins), but optimal=2 (3+3). We return greedy result: 3


coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
→ Output: 3  # 5+5+1 = 3 coins

Constraints:
* 1 ≤ len(coins) ≤ 50
* 1 ≤ coins[i] ≤ 1000 (and sorted)
* 0 ≤ amount ≤ 10⁵
