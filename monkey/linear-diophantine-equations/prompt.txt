Problem: Linear Diophantine Equations

Description:
Given integers a, b, and c, find integer solutions (x, y) to the equation:
a*x + b*y = c

The equation has integer solutions if and only if gcd(a, b) divides c.

If solutions exist, find the solution with the smallest non-negative x.
If multiple solutions have the same x, choose the one with smallest non-negative y.

Algorithm:
1. Let g = gcd(a, b)
2. If c is not divisible by g, no solution exists
3. Otherwise, find one solution using Extended Euclidean Algorithm
4. Generate the general solution and find the one with smallest non-negative x

General solution:
x = x0 + (b/g)*t
y = y0 - (a/g)*t
where (x0, y0) is a particular solution and t is any integer.

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases, 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000)
- For each test case:
  - a b c (|a|, |b|, |c| ≤ 10^9, a and b not both zero)

Output:
- For each test case:
  - If no solution exists, print "No Solution"
  - Otherwise, print "x y" where x and y are the solution with smallest non-negative x

Explanation:
Case 1: 2*2 + 3*(-1) = 4 - 3 = 1
Case 2: 4*2 + 6*(-1) = 8 - 6 = 2  
Case 3: gcd(4,6)=2, but 3 is not divisible by 2 → No solution
Case 4: 15*2 + 25*(-1) = 30 - 25 = 5
Case 5: Large coefficients

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
- |a|, |b|, |c| ≤ 10^9
- a and b are not both zero
