Problem: Find Closest Triplet Sum to Target

Description
You are a skilled Python algorithm engineer. Implement a function find_closest_triplet(arr, target) that finds three distinct elements in an integer array whose sum is closest to a given target value.
The solution must be efficient and avoid brute-force O(n³) time complexity.

Input
An integer array arr with n ≥ 3
An integer target
Array may contain duplicates and both positive/negative numbers
-10⁵ ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10⁵, -10⁶ ≤ target ≤ 10⁶

Output
Return a tuple: ((a, b, c), closest_sum) where:
a, b, c are values from distinct indices in arr
closest_sum = a + b + c
The absolute difference |closest_sum - target| is minimized
If multiple triplets yield the same minimal difference, return any one of them
Return type: tuple[tuple[int, int, int], int]

Constraints
Time Complexity: ≤ O(n²)
Space Complexity: O(1) or O(n)
Do not use brute-force triple nested loops
Handle edge cases: duplicates, all negatives, large arrays
Optimize using sorting and two-pointer technique

Key Insight
Sorting the array allows using two pointers for the inner two elements while iterating the first. For each fixed first element, adjust left/right pointers to minimize distance to target.

Examples

Example 1
Input: arr = [-1, 2, 1, -4], target = 1
Output: ((-1, 1, 2), 2)
Explanation: Sum = 2 → |2 - 1| = 1. Other sums: (-1+2-4)=-3, (2+1-4)=-1. Closest is 2.

Example 2
Input: arr = [1, 1, 1, 0], target = -100
Output: ((0, 1, 1), 2)
Explanation: All sums are ≥2. Closest to -100 is 2 (least deviation).

Example 3
Input: arr = [0, 0, 0], target = 5
Output: ((0, 0, 0), 0)
Explanation: Only possible sum is 0.

Example 4
Input: arr = [4, 0, 5, -3], target = 4
Output: ((4, 0, -3), 1) or ((0, 5, -3), 2) → Best: ((4,0,-3),1) → |1-4|=3; ((0,5,-3),2) → |2-4|=2 → So ((0,5,-3),2) is better.
Actually: ((4,5,-3),6) → |6-4|=2. So both 2 and 6 are equally close. Return any.

Your Task
Implement find_closest_triplet(arr, target) using:
Sorting
Outer loop + two-pointer inner search
Track the triplet with minimal |sum - target|
Avoid duplicate triplets (but same value from different index is allowed)
Return the optimal triplet and its sum as a 2-tuple.
