Problem: Expected Number of Steps in Random Walks

Description:
A particle starts at position 0 on a number line. At each step, it moves:
- Right by 1 with probability p
- Left by 1 with probability q  
- Stays at current position with probability r
where p + q + r = 1.

The walk stops when the particle reaches either position A (left boundary) or position B (right boundary).
Calculate the expected number of steps until the walk stops.

Mathematical Formulation:
Let E(x) be the expected number of steps starting from position x.
We have the system of equations:
E(x) = 1 + p*E(x+1) + q*E(x-1) + r*E(x)  for A < x < B
with boundary conditions: E(A) = 0, E(B) = 0

Rearranging:
E(x) - r*E(x) = 1 + p*E(x+1) + q*E(x-1)
(1-r)*E(x) = 1 + p*E(x+1) + q*E(x-1)
E(x) = (1 + p*E(x+1) + q*E(x-1)) / (1-r)

We need to solve this system of linear equations for E(0).

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases)
- For each test case:
  - First line: A B (boundaries, A < 0 < B)
  - Second line: p q r (probabilities for right, left, stay)

Output:
- For each test case: expected number of steps rounded to 6 decimal places

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- -100 ≤ A < 0 < B ≤ 100
- 0 ≤ p, q, r ≤ 1, p + q + r = 1

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
2
-1 1
0.5 0.5 0.0
-2 2
0.3 0.3 0.4

Output:
1.000000
6.666667

Explanation:
First case: Symmetric random walk from 0 to ±1. 
Expected steps = 1 because with p=0.5, q=0.5, the particle reaches boundary in 1 step.

Second case: With staying probability 0.4, it takes more steps on average.
The exact value 6.666667 is calculated by solving the linear system.

Example 2:
Input:
1
-3 3
0.4 0.4 0.2

Output:
11.250000

Example 3:
Input:
1
-5 5
0.33 0.33 0.34

Output:
37.878788

Implementation Approach:
1. Set up a system of linear equations for E(x) where x ranges from A to B
2. Use Gaussian elimination to solve the system
3. Return E(0) rounded to 6 decimal places

Note: The actual values may differ from intuitive estimates due to the staying probability.
The examples above show the exact outputs from the implemented solution.
