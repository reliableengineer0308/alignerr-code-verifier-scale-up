Problem: "Periodic String Analyzer"
In the digital signal processing lab, researchers are analyzing periodic patterns in data streams. 
They need to find the longest prefix of a signal that is periodic with a period that repeats at least twice. 
A periodic string can be expressed as multiple repetitions of a smaller substring. Your task is to find the length of the longest prefix that is periodic.

Given a string of integers, find the length of the longest prefix that can be expressed as multiple repetitions of a smaller substring (with the period length being at most half the prefix length). 
If no such prefix exists, return 0.

Input Format
The input will be provided as a single string containing:
First line: length of the string (n)
Second line: the string (as space-separated integers)

Output Format
A single integer representing the length of the longest periodic prefix.

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 10,000,000

The string consists of integers from 0 to 255

# Required API
```python
def solve(data):
    lines = data.strip().split('\n')
    n = int(lines[0])
    arr = list(map(int, lines[1].split()))

Example 1:
Function: solve(data)
Input: data = """"6
1 2 1 2 1 2"""
Output: 6


Example 2:
Function: solve(data)
Input: data = """3
1 2 3"""
Output: 0
