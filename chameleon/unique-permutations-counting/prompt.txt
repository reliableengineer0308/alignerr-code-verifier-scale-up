Problem: Unique Permutations Counting

Description:
Given a string (or list) with possibly repeated characters, compute the number of unique permutations that can be formed. Unlike standard permutations, duplicates must be excluded (e.g., "aab" has 3 unique permutations: "aab", "aba", "baa").

Input:
* s: String (or list of characters) with possible duplicates

Output:
* Integer: Count of unique permutations of s

Key Insight:
If all characters were unique, the count would be n! (n = length). But when characters repeat, we divide by the factorial of each character’s frequency to avoid overcounting.

Formula:
Unique Permutations=n!/(f1!*f2!*...fk!)
​where:
n = length of string
fi = frequency of the i-th distinct character

Requirements:
1. Handle strings with repeated characters.
2. Return 1 for empty string or single character.
3. Use efficient factorial computation (avoid recomputing).
4. Edge cases:
 * Empty string → 1
 * All characters same → 1
 * No duplicates → n#

Algorithm Hints:
1. Count frequency of each character (use dict or Counter).
2. Compute n!.
3. For each frequency f, divide by f!.
4. Use integer arithmetic (no floating-point division).

Examples:
s = "abc! → 6  # All unique: 3# = 6
s = "aab! → 3  # (3!)/(2!1!) = 6/2 = 3
s = "aaa! → 1  # Only one permutation possible
s = "abcd! → 24 # 4# = 24
s = "" → 1     # Empty string has one permutation (empty)
s = "aabb! → 6 # (4!)/(2!2!) = 24/4 = 6

Constraints:
* 0 ≤ len(s) ≤ 10
* Characters are ASCII letters (case-sensitive)
* Input can be empty

Note: The result fits in a 64-bit integer for len(s) ≤ 10.
