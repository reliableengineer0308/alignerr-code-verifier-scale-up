Problem: Find Local Minimum in Array using Ternary Search

Description:
Given an array of distinct integers, find a local minimum. A local minimum is an element that is 
smaller than its neighbors. For boundary elements, only consider the existing neighbor.

The array is not sorted but has the property that adjacent elements are distinct.

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases, 1 ≤ T ≤ 100)
- For each test case:
  - First line: n (array size, 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
  - Second line: n distinct integers (array elements, -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9)

Output:
- For each test case:
  - Print "Case #X: Y" where X is test case number, Y is the value of a local minimum

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
3
7
9 7 8 6 5 4 3
5
1 2 3 4 5
6
10 2 3 1 5 6

Output:
Case #1: 5
Case #2: 1
Case #3: 1

Explanation:
Case 1: Local minima could be 7, 6, 5, 4, or 3. The algorithm can find any of them.
Case 2: Only local minimum is 1 (left boundary)
Case 3: Local minima are 2 or 1

Algorithm:
Use ternary search inspired approach:
1. Check boundaries first
2. Use binary/ternary search style to find local minimum
3. Compare middle element with neighbors to decide which half to search

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- All elements are distinct
- Adjacent elements are distinct
