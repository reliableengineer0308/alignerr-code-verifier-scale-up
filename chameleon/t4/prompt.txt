Problem: Traveling Salesman Problem with Bitmask DP

Description:
Given N cities and a distance matrix, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

Input:
- First line: N (number of cities)
- Next N lines: N integers each (distance matrix, INF if no direct path)

Output:
- Print the minimum cost of Hamiltonian cycle
- Print "No path exists" if no valid cycle
- Print the path if exists

Constraints:
- 2 ≤ N ≤ 20
- 0 ≤ distances ≤ 1000
- Cities are 0-indexed

Example:
Input:
4
0 10 15 20
10 0 35 25
15 35 0 30
20 25 30 0

Output:
Minimum cost: 80
Path: 0 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 0

Algorithm Requirements:
- Use dynamic programming with bitmask state representation
- State: dp[mask][last] = minimum cost to visit cities in mask ending at last
- Handle both symmetric and asymmetric TSP
- Reconstruct the optimal path
