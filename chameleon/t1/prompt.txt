Problem: Prime Path Transformation

Description:
You are given two 4-digit prime numbers A and B. Your task is to convert A to B by changing one digit at a time, 
such that every intermediate number formed during the transformation is also a 4-digit prime number.

Mathematical Constraint:
At each step, you can change exactly one digit of the current number to obtain the next number in the sequence. 
All numbers in the transformation path must be 4-digit prime numbers (between 1000 and 9999).

Input:
- A: starting number (1000 ≤ A ≤ 9999)
- B: target number (1000 ≤ B ≤ 9999)
- A and B are not necessarily prime numbers

Output:
- Print appropriate English messages based on the result:
  - If A or B is not a 4-digit prime: "Error: A is not a 4-digit prime number" or "Error: B is not a 4-digit prime number"
  - If no path exists: "Error: Cannot generate path from A to B"
  - If path exists: "Shortest path found (length: N)" and print the path
- Return the path as a list (or empty list if no path/invalid input)

Example 1:
Input: A = 1033, B = 8179
Output: 
"Shortest path found (length: 7)"
"Path: 1033 → 1733 → 3733 → 3739 → 3779 → 8779 → 8179"
Return: [1033, 1733, 3733, 3739, 3779, 8779, 8179]

Example 2:
Input: A = 1000, B = 8179
Output: "Error: 1000 is not a 4-digit prime number"
Return: []

Example 3:
Input: A = 1033, B = 1000
Output: "Error: 1000 is not a 4-digit prime number"
Return: []

Example 4:
Input: A = 1033, B = 1033
Output: "Shortest path found (length: 1)"
"Path: 1033"
Return: [1033]

Example 5:
Input: A = 1009, B = 9973  # If no path exists
Output: "Error: Cannot generate path from 1009 to 9973"
Return: []

Constraints:
- 1000 ≤ A, B ≤ 9999
- A and B must be prime numbers for transformation to be possible
- The solution should efficiently handle the search space
- Use BFS (Breadth-First Search) for shortest path finding

Important Validation:
- First check if A and B are 4-digit prime numbers
- Only proceed with BFS if both are valid primes
- Print clear English error messages for invalid cases
- Print success message with path length when path exists
- Display the actual path with arrow separators

Algorithm Steps:
1. Validate that A and B are 4-digit prime numbers
2. Generate all 4-digit prime numbers (1000-9999) using Sieve of Eratosthenes
3. Build a graph where edges connect primes that differ by exactly one digit
4. Use BFS to find the shortest path from A to B
5. Print appropriate messages and return the path

Output Requirements:
- For invalid input: Print error message and return empty list
- For no path: Print error message and return empty list  
- For success: Print success message with path length and the actual path
- Always return the path list (or empty list) for testing purposes

Efficiency Considerations:
- Precompute all primes and graph structure for optimal performance
- Use BFS for shortest path finding
- Handle large search space (1061 four-digit primes) efficiently
