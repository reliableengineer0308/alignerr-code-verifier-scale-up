Problem: Valid Sudoku

## Problem Description
Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid according to the standard Sudoku rules. The board may be partially filled, and empty cells are represented by '.' characters.

The validation must verify three key constraints:
1. **Row Constraint**: Each of the 9 rows must contain digits 1-9 without any repetition.
2. **Column Constraint**: Each of the 9 columns must contain digits 1-9 without any repetition.
3. **Sub-box Constraint**: Each of the 9 non-overlapping 3x3 sub-boxes (also called blocks) must contain digits 1-9 without any repetition.

Important Note: A valid Sudoku board does not necessarily need to be solvable. The validation only checks for duplicate digits in rows, columns, and sub-boxes. It does not determine if the puzzle has a solution.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, there are exactly 9 lines. Each line contains exactly 9 characters.
- Each character is either a digit from '1' to '9' or a '.' representing an empty cell.

## Output Format
- For each test case, output a single line containing either "true" if the board is valid, or "false" if it violates any of the Sudoku rules.
- Output for each test case should be on a separate line.

## Constraints
- The board dimensions are fixed: 9 rows × 9 columns
- All input characters are guaranteed to be either digits 1-9 or '.'
- The number of test cases T is reasonable for efficient validation

## Example 1: Valid Complex Board
### Input
1
53..7....
6..195...
.98....6.
8...6...3
4..8.3..1
7...2...6
.6....28.
...419..5
....8..79

### Output
true

### Explanation
This board satisfies all Sudoku rules:
- No repeated digits in any row
- No repeated digits in any column  
- No repeated digits in any 3x3 sub-box
This is the classic valid Sudoku example.

## Example 2: Invalid Due to Row Violation
### Input
1
53..7....
6..195...
.98....6.
8...6...3
4..8.3..1
7...2...6
.6....28.
...419..5
....8.779

### Output
false

### Explanation
Last row has duplicate 7: ....8.779 (positions 5 and 7)

## Example 3: Invalid Due to Sub-box Violation
### Input
1
53..7....
6..195...
.98....6.
8...6...3
4..8.3..1
7...2...6
.6....28.
...419..5
....87.79

### Output
false

### Explanation
Bottom-right 3x3 sub-box has duplicate 7 and 9:
- Position (7,7): '7'
- Position (8,6): '7' 
- Position (8,8): '9' (but there's another 9 in the same sub-box)

## Example 4: Complex Valid Board
### Input
1
.6.9..2..
..7...6.4
4.3.8..7.
.7.1.5.3.
9.......1
.2.6.9.8.
.1..5.4.9
5.8...3..
..4..1.7.

### Output
false

### Explanation
This complex board with many empty cells satisfies all Sudoku rules. All placed digits follow the row, column, and sub-box constraints.

## Algorithm Requirements
- Check all three constraints: rows, columns, and 3x3 sub-boxes
- Use efficient data structures (sets, arrays, or boolean markers) to track seen digits
- Time complexity: O(1) since board size is fixed (9×9 = 81 cells)
- Space complexity: O(1) additional space for tracking
- Handle '.' characters appropriately (ignore them in duplicate checks)
