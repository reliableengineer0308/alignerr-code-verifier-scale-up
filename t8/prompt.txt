Problem: 2-SAT Problem

Description:
The 2-SAT problem involves determining whether there exists a truth assignment to boolean variables that satisfies a given propositional formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF), where each clause contains exactly two literals.

A 2-SAT formula consists of:
- N boolean variables: x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ
- M clauses of the form: (l₁ ∨ l₂) where each lᵢ is either a variable or its negation

Detailed Explanation:
- Each clause (A ∨ B) means "A OR B" where A and B can be variables or their negations
- The formula is satisfiable if there exists an assignment of True/False to all variables that makes ALL clauses True
- For a clause (A ∨ B) to be True, at least one of A or B must be True
- Positive numbers represent variables: 1 = x₁, 2 = x₂, etc.
- Negative numbers represent negated variables: -1 = ¬x₁, -2 = ¬x₂, etc.

Key Insight:
The clause (A ∨ B) is logically equivalent to:
(¬A → B) AND (¬B → A)
This allows us to build an implication graph and use strongly connected components (SCC) to solve the problem.

Input Format:
- First line: N M (number of variables, number of clauses)
- Next M lines: a b (each representing a clause (a ∨ b))
  - Positive numbers represent variables: 1 = x₁, 2 = x₂, etc.
  - Negative numbers represent negated variables: -1 = ¬x₁, -2 = ¬x₂, etc.

Output Format:
- If unsatisfiable: print "UNSATISFIABLE"
- If satisfiable: 
  First line: "SATISFIABLE"
  Second line: assignment for variables 1 to N as space-separated 1/0 values
  (1 = True, 0 = False)

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10000
- 1 ≤ M ≤ 100000

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
3 4
1 2
-2 -3
-1 3
3 -2

Output:
SATISFIABLE
1 0 1

Explanation: 
Clauses: (x₁ ∨ x₂) ∧ (¬x₂ ∨ ¬x₃) ∧ (¬x₁ ∨ x₃) ∧ (x₃ ∨ ¬x₂)
Assignment: x₁=True, x₂=False, x₃=True satisfies all clauses:
- (True ∨ False) = True
- (True ∨ False) = True  (¬False=True, ¬True=False)
- (False ∨ True) = True
- (True ∨ True) = True   (¬False=True)

Example 2:
Input:
2 3
1 2
-1 2
-2 -2

Output:
UNSATISFIABLE

Explanation:
Clauses: (x₁ ∨ x₂) ∧ (¬x₁ ∨ x₂) ∧ (¬x₂ ∨ ¬x₂)
The last clause (¬x₂ ∨ ¬x₂) is equivalent to ¬x₂, which creates a contradiction with other constraints.

Example 3:
Input:
1 2
1 -1
-1 1

Output:
SATISFIABLE
1

Explanation:
Clauses: (x₁ ∨ ¬x₁) ∧ (¬x₁ ∨ x₁) 
This is always satisfiable since it's equivalent to (x₁ OR NOT x₁) which is always True.

Algorithm Requirements:
1. Convert the 2-SAT problem to an implication graph with 2N nodes
   - For each variable x, create two nodes: x (2i) and ¬x (2i+1)
   - For each clause (A ∨ B), add edges: ¬A → B and ¬B → A
2. Use Kosaraju's algorithm to find strongly connected components (SCC)
3. Check if any variable and its negation are in the same SCC
   - If yes: UNSATISFIABLE (contradiction)
   - If no: SATISFIABLE
4. If satisfiable, assign values based on topological order of SCCs
   - If SCC[x] < SCC[¬x], set x = True
   - Otherwise set x = False
