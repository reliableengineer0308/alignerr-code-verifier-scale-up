Problem: Voronoi Diagram Construction

Description:
Given a set of points (sites) in a 2D plane, construct the Voronoi diagram and answer queries about which site is closest to a given query point.

The Voronoi diagram partitions the plane into regions where each region contains all points closer to one particular site than to any other.

Input:
- First line: N (number of sites)
- Next N lines: x y (coordinates of each site)
- Next line: Q (number of queries)
- Next Q lines: x y (query point coordinates)

Output:
- For each query, output the index (0-indexed) of the closest site
- If multiple sites are equally close, output the smallest index

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10000
- -10^6 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^6
- No three sites are colinear

Algorithm Requirements:
- Implement Fortune's algorithm or divide and conquer approach
- Handle Voronoi cell construction efficiently
- Answer queries using the Voronoi diagram structure

Example:
Input:
5
0 0
4 0
4 4
0 4
2 2
6
1 1
3 3
5 5
2 0
2 4
0 2

Output:
0
2
2
0
2
0

Explanation:
- Sites: 0:(0,0), 1:(4,0), 2:(4,4), 3:(0,4), 4:(2,2)
- Query results show the closest site for each query point
- (1,1) is closest to site: min(0,4), (3,3) to site min(2,4), etc.
