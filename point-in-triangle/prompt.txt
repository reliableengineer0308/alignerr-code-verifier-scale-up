Problem: Point in Triangle

Description:
Implement a function is_point_in_triangle(p, v1, v2, v3) that determines whether a given point p lies inside, on the edge, or outside a triangle defined by vertices v1, v2, v3.

Input:
* p: tuple (x, y) — coordinates of the point to check
* v1, v2, v3: tuples (x, y) — coordinates of triangle vertices
* All coordinates are floats in range [-1000, 1000]

Output:
String: "inside" (strict interior), "edge" (on boundary), or "outside"

Method:
Use the cross product approach:
1. For each edge of the triangle, compute the cross product between the edge vector and the vector from edge start to point.
2. The signs of cross products indicate position:
 * All same sign → inside
 * One zero, others same sign → on edge
 * Mixed signs → outside

Examples:
Example 1:
p = (1, 1)
v1, v2, v3 = (0, 0), (2, 0), (0, 2)
→ "inside"

Example 2:
p = (1, 0)
v1, v2, v3 = (0, 0), (2, 0), (0, 2)
→ "edge"

Example 3:
p = (3, 3)
v1, v2, v3 = (0, 0), (2, 0), (0, 2)
→ "outside"

Constraints:
- Time complexity: O(1)
- Space complexity: O(1)
- Handle floating-point precision (use small epsilon for comparisons)
