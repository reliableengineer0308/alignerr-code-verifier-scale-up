Problem: Primitive Roots

Description:
Given a prime number p, find the smallest primitive root modulo p.
A primitive root modulo p is an integer g such that every number coprime to p is congruent to a power of g modulo p.

Equivalently, g is a primitive root if the smallest positive integer k for which g^k ≡ 1 (mod p) is k = p-1.

Algorithm:
1. Factorize p-1 into prime factors
2. For each candidate g from 2 to p-1:
   - Check if g^((p-1)/q) ≠ 1 (mod p) for all prime factors q of p-1
   - The first g that satisfies this is the smallest primitive root

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases, 1 ≤ T ≤ 100)
- For each test case:
  - p (2 ≤ p ≤ 10^6, p is prime)

Output:
- For each test case:
  - Print the smallest primitive root modulo p

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
5
2
3
5
7
11

Output:
1
2
2
3
2

Explanation:
Case 1: For p=2, primitive root is 1
Case 2: For p=3, primitive root is 2 (2^1=2, 2^2=4≡1 mod 3)
Case 3: For p=5, primitive root is 2 (2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8≡3, 2^4=16≡1 mod 5)
Case 4: For p=7, primitive root is 3
Case 5: For p=11, primitive root is 2

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 2 ≤ p ≤ 10^6
- p is prime
