Problem: Minkowski Sum of Polygons

Description:
Given two convex polygons A and B, compute their Minkowski sum A ⊕ B = {a + b | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}.
The Minkowski sum of two convex polygons is also a convex polygon.

Input:
- First line: N (number of vertices in polygon A)
- Next N lines: x y (vertices of polygon A in counter-clockwise order)
- Next line: M (number of vertices in polygon B)  
- Next M lines: x y (vertices of polygon B in counter-clockwise order)

Output:
- First line: K (number of vertices in Minkowski sum polygon)
- Next K lines: x y (vertices of Minkowski sum in counter-clockwise order)

Constraints:
- 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 1000
- -10^6 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^6
- Both polygons are convex and given in counter-clockwise order

Algorithm Requirements:
- Implement Minkowski sum using convolution of polygons
- Handle edge cases (degenerate polygons, etc.)
- Output convex hull of the sum

Example:
Input:
4
0 0
2 0
2 2
0 2
3
0 0
1 0
0 1

Output:
5
0 0
3 0
3 2
2 3
0 3

Explanation:
- Polygon A: square from (0,0) to (2,2)
- Polygon B: right triangle with vertices (0,0), (1,0), (0,1)
- Minkowski sum is a pentagon representing all possible sums
- The result has 5 vertices as shown
