Problem Description: Network Packet Routing
In the city of Cyberville, there's a complex network of routers that forward data packets. Each router has a processing capacity and connections to other routers. Your task is to determine the minimum time required for a packet to travel from a source router to a destination router, considering that each router takes a certain amount of time to process the packet before forwarding it.

The network is represented as an undirected graph where:

Each node represents a router with a processing time

Each edge represents a direct connection between routers with a transmission time

The total time to travel from router A to router B is the sum of:

Processing time at router A

Transmission time from A to B

Processing time at router B (if B is not the final destination)

However, if you're at the final destination, you don't need to process the packet again.

Input Format:
The input will be provided as a list of integers in the following order:

Number of routers N

Number of connections M

Source router S

Destination router D

List of N integers representing processing times for each router (0-indexed)

List of M*3 integers representing connections: [router_u, router_v, transmission_time] for each connection

Constraints:

2 ≤ N ≤ 1000

1 ≤ M ≤ 10000

0 ≤ S, D ≤ N-1, S ≠ D

Processing times: 1 ≤ p_i ≤ 100

Transmission times: 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 100

Output Format:
A single integer representing the minimum total time required, or -1 if unreachable.

Example 1:
Function: solve(arr)
Input: arr = [3, 2, 0, 2, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 5, 1, 2, 4]

Example 2:
Function: solve(arr)
Input: arr = [2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 10]
Output: 11
