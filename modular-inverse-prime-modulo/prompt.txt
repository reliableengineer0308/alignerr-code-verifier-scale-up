Problem: Modular Inverse Under Prime Modulo

Description:
Given a prime number M and an integer A, find the modular inverse of A modulo M.
The modular inverse of A modulo M is an integer X such that (A * X) % M = 1.
If no such inverse exists (which won't happen when M is prime and A is not divisible by M), return -1.

You must use Fermat's Little Theorem:
If M is prime and A is not divisible by M, then A^(M-2) % M is the modular inverse of A modulo M.

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases, 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000)
- For each test case:
  - A M (1 ≤ A ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ M ≤ 10^9, M is prime)

Output:
- For each test case:
  - Print the modular inverse of A modulo M, or -1 if it doesn't exist.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
3
3 11
10 17
5 5

Output:
4
12
-1

Explanation:
Case 1: 3 * 4 = 12 ≡ 1 mod 11
Case 2: 10 * 12 = 120 ≡ 1 mod 17
Case 3: 5 mod 5 = 0, no inverse exists

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^9
- 2 ≤ M ≤ 10^9, M is prime
