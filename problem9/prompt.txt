Problem: Flood Evacuation

A severe flood has hit a city, and people are trapped in various buildings. 
Rescue teams have boats that can navigate between buildings. 
Each building has a certain number of people, and each water route between buildings has a capacity limit (maximum number of people that can be transported per hour).
Your task is to determine the maximum number of people that can be evacuated from all source buildings to safe zones within the next 6 hours. 
There are multiple source buildings (where people are trapped) and multiple safe zones. Each boat can make multiple trips in 6 hours.

Input Format
The input consists of:
First line: 3 integers - number of buildings (n), number of water routes (m), number of safe zones (k)
Next line: k integers - the building IDs of safe zones (0-indexed)
Next n lines: each with 1 integer - number of people in each building
Next m lines: each with 3 integers - source building, destination building, capacity per hour

Output Format
A single integer: the maximum number of people that can be evacuated in 6 hours.

Constraints
2 ≤ n ≤ 100
1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
1 ≤ k ≤ 20
0 ≤ number of people per building ≤ 1000
0 ≤ capacity per route ≤ 500
