Problem: Simulated Annealing for Traveling Salesman Problem

Description:
Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem using Simulated Annealing algorithm.
Given N cities with coordinates, find a tour that visits each city exactly once and returns to the start city, minimizing the total distance.

Input:
- First line: N (number of cities)
- Next N lines: x y (coordinates of each city)

Output:
- First line: total_distance (rounded to 6 decimal places)
- Next line: tour (space-separated city indices in visit order, 0-indexed)

Constraints:
- 10 ≤ N ≤ 1000
- 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10000
- Cities are 0-indexed

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
5
0 0
1 3
3 1
5 2
4 4

Output:
12.485281
0 1 2 3 4

Example 2:
Input:
8
1 1
2 3
4 2
5 5
3 7
6 8
8 6
7 3

Output:
25.584025
0 1 2 7 6 5 4 3

Implementation Approach:
1. Use Simulated Annealing with geometric cooling schedule
2. Start with random initial tour
3. Use 2-opt moves for neighborhood search
4. Gradually decrease temperature
5. Return the best found solution
