Problem: Discrete Logarithm using Baby-Step Giant-Step Algorithm

Description:
Given a prime modulus p, a base g, and a target value h, find the smallest non-negative integer x such that:
g^x ≡ h (mod p)

This is known as the discrete logarithm problem. Use the Baby-Step Giant-Step algorithm which has time complexity O(√p log p).

Algorithm:
1. Let m = ceil(√(p-1))
2. Baby Step: Precompute g^j mod p for j = 0, 1, ..., m-1 and store in a hash table
3. Giant Step: Compute h * g^(-im) mod p for i = 0, 1, ..., m-1 and check if it exists in the hash table
4. If found, solution is x = i*m + j

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases, 1 ≤ T ≤ 100)
- For each test case:
  - p g h (2 ≤ p ≤ 10^9, p is prime, 1 ≤ g, h < p)

Output:
- For each test case:
  - Print the smallest non-negative integer x satisfying g^x ≡ h (mod p)
  - If no solution exists, print -1

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
3
23 5 3
1000000007 2 1
1000000007 3 2

Output:
16
0
-1

Explanation:
Case 1: 5^16 ≡ 3 (mod 23)
Case 2: 2^0 ≡ 1 (mod 1000000007)
Case 3: No solution exists for 3^x ≡ 2 (mod 1000000007)

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 2 ≤ p ≤ 10^9, p is prime
- 1 ≤ g, h < p
