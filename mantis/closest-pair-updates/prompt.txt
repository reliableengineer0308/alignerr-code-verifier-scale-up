Problem: Closest Pair with Dynamic Updates

Description:
You are given a set of points in a 2D plane that supports two operations:
1. Add a new point to the set
2. Remove an existing point from the set
3. Query the current closest pair distance

After each operation, you need to efficiently maintain and query the closest pair distance.

Input:
- First line: Q (number of operations)
- Next Q lines, each containing one of:
  - "ADD x y" - Add point (x, y)
  - "REMOVE x y" - Remove point (x, y) (guaranteed to exist)
  - "QUERY" - Query current closest pair distance

Output:
- For each QUERY operation, output the squared distance of the closest pair
- If there are less than 2 points, output "0"

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ Q ≤ 50000
- -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9
- Total number of points at any time ≤ 20000

Algorithm Requirements:
- Use line sweep or divide and conquer approach
- Handle dynamic updates efficiently
- Use balanced BST or spatial partitioning

Example:
Input:
12
ADD 0 0
ADD 1 1
QUERY
ADD 3 3
ADD 2 2
QUERY
REMOVE 1 1
QUERY
ADD 0 1
ADD 1 0
QUERY
REMOVE 0 0
QUERY

Output:
2
2
2
1
1

Explanation:
- After first two points: closest pair is (0,0)-(1,1) with squared distance 2
- After adding more points: closest pair changes
- After removal: distances update accordingly
