Problem: 3Sum

Description:
Implement a function three_sum(nums) that finds all unique triplets in the array nums such that the sum of the three numbers is zero. Return a list of triplets, where each triplet is sorted in non-decreasing order. The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Your task:
- Find all unique triplets (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 0
- Return triplets sorted internally and as a whole (lexicographic order)
- Avoid duplicate triplets (e.g., [−1,0,1] and [−1,0,1] should appear only once)
- Use efficient approach (avoid O(n³) brute force)

Input:
- List nums of integers (3 ≤ len(nums) ≤ 3000)
- Each num satisfies −10⁵ ≤ num ≤ 10⁵

Output:
- List of lists: each inner list is a triplet [a, b, c] with a ≤ b ≤ c and a + b + c = 0
- Triplets must be unique and sorted lexicographically

Examples:
Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]
Explanation: 
- (-1) + (-1) + 2 = 0
- (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0, 1, 1]
Output: []
Explanation: No valid triplet sums to zero.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [0, 0, 0]
Output: [[0, 0, 0]]

Constraints:
3 ≤ len(nums) ≤ 3000
−10⁵ ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁵
Time complexity: O(n²) expected
Space complexity: O(1) extra space (not counting output)

Notes:
- Sort the array first to enable two-pointer technique
- For each i, use two pointers (left, right) to find pairs such that nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right] == 0
- Skip duplicate values at i, left, and right to avoid duplicate triplets
- Handle edge cases: all zeros, all positive/negative, minimal input
