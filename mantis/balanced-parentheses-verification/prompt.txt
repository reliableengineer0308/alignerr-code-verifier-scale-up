Problem: Balanced Parentheses Verification

Description:
Implement a function that checks whether a given string has balanced parentheses. The string may contain:
* Round brackets: ()
* Square brackets: []
* Curly braces: {}
* Other characters (letters, digits, symbols) — to be ignored

A string is balanced if:
1. Every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket of the same type.
2. Brackets are closed in the correct order (last opened must be closed first).

Input:
* s: String (length ≤ 10⁴)

Output:
* Boolean: True if parentheses are balanced, False otherwise

Algorithm Requirements:
1. Use a stack to track opening brackets.
2. Process each character:
 - If it’s an opening bracket ((, [, {), push it onto the stack.
 - If it’s a closing bracket (), ], }):
  * Pop from the stack and check if it matches the closing bracket.
  * If stack is empty or mismatch → unbalanced.
 - Ignore all other characters.
3. After processing:
 - Stack must be empty (all brackets closed).

Edge Cases:
* Empty string → True
* nly non-bracket characters → True
* Unmatched opening brackets → False
* Unmatched closing brackets → False
* Nested brackets of different types → must respect order

Complexity:
* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(n) (stack size)

Constraints:
* Do not use regex or external libraries.
* Handle strings up to 10,000 characters.
