Problem: Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

Description:
Given a sorted array of integers and a target value, find the starting and ending position of the target.
If target is not found, return [-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases, 1 ≤ T ≤ 100)
- For each test case:
  - First line: n target (array size and target value, 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, -10^9 ≤ target ≤ 10^9)
  - Second line: n integers (sorted array in non-decreasing order, -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9)

Output:
- For each test case:
  - Print "Case #X: start end" where X is test case number, start and end are the indices
  - If not found, print "Case #X: -1 -1"

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
3
6 8
5 7 7 8 8 10
5 6
1 2 3 4 5
7 4
4 4 4 4 4 4 4

Output:
Case #1: 3 4
Case #2: -1 -1
Case #3: 0 6

Explanation:
Case 1: Target 8 appears at indices 3 and 4
Case 2: Target 6 not found
Case 3: Target 4 appears from index 0 to 6

Algorithm:
Use two binary searches:
1. First binary search to find the first occurrence (left bound)
2. Second binary search to find the last occurrence (right bound)

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- -10^9 ≤ target, a_i ≤ 10^9
