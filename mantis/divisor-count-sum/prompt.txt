Problem: Divisor Count and Sum

Description:
Given an integer N, find:
1. The number of divisors of N
2. The sum of divisors of N

If the prime factorization of N is: N = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak, then:
- Number of divisors: d(N) = (a1 + 1) * (a2 + 1) * ... * (ak + 1)
- Sum of divisors: σ(N) = (p1^(a1+1)-1)/(p1-1) * (p2^(a2+1)-1)/(p2-1) * ... * (pk^(ak+1)-1)/(pk-1)

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases, 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000)
- For each test case:
  - N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6)

Output:
- For each test case:
  - Print "count sum" where count is number of divisors and sum is sum of divisors

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
5
1
12
100
999983
1000000

Output:
1 1
6 28
9 217
2 999984
49 2480437

Explanation:
Case 1: 1 has 1 divisor (1), sum = 1
Case 2: 12 has divisors 1,2,3,4,6,12 → count=6, sum=28
Case 3: 100 = 2^2 * 5^2 → divisors count = (2+1)*(2+1)=9, sum = (2^3-1)/(2-1) * (5^3-1)/(5-1) = 7 * 31 = 217
Case 4: 999983 is prime → divisors: 1, 999983 → count=2, sum=999984
Case 5: 1000000 = 2^6 * 5^6 → divisors count = (6+1)*(6+1)=49, sum = (2^7-1)/(2-1) * (5^7-1)/(5-1) = 127 * 19531 = 2480437

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
