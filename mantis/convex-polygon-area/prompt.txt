Problem: Convex Polygon Area

Description:
Implement a function polygon_area(vertices) that calculates the area of a convex polygon given its vertices in order (either clockwise or counterclockwise).

Your task:
- Use the Shoelace formula (also known as the surveyor’s formula)
- Handle both clockwise and counterclockwise vertex ordering
- Return the absolute value of the area (always positive)

Input:
* vertices: list of tuples [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn)]
* 3 ≤ len(vertices) ≤ 1000
* Each coordinate: -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000
* Vertices are given in order around the polygon

Output:
Float: area of the polygon (rounded to 6 decimal places)

Method (Shoelace Formula):
For vertices (x₁,y₁), (x₂,y₂), ..., (xn,yn):
	Area= 1/2 |∑_{i=1}^n (x_i * y_{i+1} − x_{i+1} y_i​)|
where (xn+1, yn+1) = (x₁, y₁) (wrap around).

Examples:
Example 1:
python
vertices = [(0, 0), (4, 0), (4, 3), (0, 3)]
→ 12.0

Example 2:
python
vertices = [(1, 1), (3, 1), (2, 4)]
→ 3.0

Constraints:
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)
- Handle floating-point precision (round to 6 decimals)
