Problem: Search in Rotated Sorted Array

## Problem Description
You are given an array of integers that was originally sorted in ascending order but has been rotated at some unknown pivot. 
For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]. Your task is to find the index of a given target value in this rotated array. 
If the target is not found, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

## Input Format
- First line: T (number of test cases)
- For each test case:
  - First line: N (size of the array)
  - Second line: array elements (space-separated integers)
  - Third line: target value

## Output Format
- For each test case: the index of target in the array, or -1 if not found

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- -10^4 ≤ array[i], target ≤ 10^4
- All values in the array are unique

## Example 1: Basic Case
### Input
2
7
4 5 6 7 0 1 2
0
4
1 3 5 7
2

### Output
4
-1

### Explanation
**Test Case 1:**
Array: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], Target: 0
The target 0 is at index 4.

**Test Case 2:**
Array: [1,3,5,7], Target: 2
The target 2 is not in the array, so return -1.

## Example 2: Not Rotated
### Input
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
3

### Output
2

### Explanation
The array is not rotated (already sorted). Target 3 is at index 2.

## Example 3: Single Element
### Input
1
1
5
5

### Output
0

### Explanation
Array has only one element which matches the target.

## Algorithm Requirements
- Use modified binary search
- Time complexity: O(log n)
- Handle both rotated and non-rotated cases
