Problem: Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

Description:
Given an integer N and a list of prime numbers, count how many numbers between 1 and N (inclusive)
are divisible by at least one of the given primes.

Use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:
|A1 ∪ A2 ∪ ... ∪ Ak| = Σ|Ai| - Σ|Ai ∩ Aj| + Σ|Ai ∩ Aj ∩ Ak| - ... + (-1)^(k+1)|A1 ∩ A2 ∩ ... ∩ Ak|

Where Ai is the set of numbers divisible by the i-th prime.

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases, 1 ≤ T ≤ 10)
- For each test case:
  - First line: N K (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ K ≤ 20)
  - Second line: K space-separated primes (each prime between 2 and 100)

Output:
- For each test case:
  - Print the count of numbers between 1 and N divisible by at least one of the given primes

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
2
100 2
2 3
1000 3
2 3 5

Output:
67
734

Explanation:
Case 1: Numbers divisible by 2 or 3 up to 100
Count = floor(100/2) + floor(100/3) - floor(100/6) = 50 + 33 - 16 = 67

Case 2: Numbers divisible by 2, 3, or 5 up to 1000
Using inclusion-exclusion: 
floor(1000/2) + floor(1000/3) + floor(1000/5) 
- floor(1000/6) - floor(1000/10) - floor(1000/15) 
+ floor(1000/30) 
= 500 + 333 + 200 - 166 - 100 - 66 + 33 = 734

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9
- 1 ≤ K ≤ 20
- Primes are between 2 and 100
