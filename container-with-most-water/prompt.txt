Problem: Container With Most Water

Description:
Implement a function max_area(height) that returns the maximum area of water a container can store. Given n non-negative integers representing points at coordinates (i, height[i]), find two lines that, together with the x-axis, form a container holding the most water.

Your task:
- Find the pair of lines (i, j) such that the container between them holds maximum water
- Area = min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i)
- Use an efficient two-pointer approach
- Return the maximum possible area

Input:
- List height of n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵)
- Each height[i] is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ height[i] ≤ 10⁴)

Output:
Integer: maximum area achievable

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The max area is between indices 1 and 8: min(8,7) * (8-1) = 7 * 7 = 49.

Example 2:
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Area = min(1,1) * (1-0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

Constraints:
2 ≤ len(height) ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ height[i] ≤ 10^4
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

Notes:
- Use two pointers (left and right)
- Start with left = 0, right = len(height) - 1
- At each step:
 * Calculate current area
 * Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward
 * Update maximum area
- Why move the shorter pointer? Because the area is limited by the shorter line, and moving the taller one can’t increase the potential max area
- Handle edge cases: minimal array, equal heights, descending/ascending order
