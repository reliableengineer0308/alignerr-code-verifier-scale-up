Problem: Find K-th Smallest Element in Two Sorted Arrays

Description:
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2, and an integer k, find the k-th smallest element in the combined sorted array.

You must solve it in O(log(min(m,n))) time complexity.

Input:
- First line: T (number of test cases, 1 ≤ T ≤ 100)
- For each test case:
  - First line: m n k (sizes of two arrays and k, 1 ≤ m,n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ m+n)
  - Second line: m integers (first sorted array)
  - Third line: n integers (second sorted array)

Output:
- For each test case:
  - Print "Case #X: Y" where X is test case number, Y is the k-th smallest element

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
3
4 4 4
1 3 5 7
2 4 6 8
3 3 3
1 2 3
4 5 6
2 2 2
1 2
3 4

Output:
Case #1: 4
Case #2: 3
Case #3: 2

Explanation:
Case 1: Combined array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], 4th smallest is 4
Case 2: Combined array [1,2,3,4,5,6], 3rd smallest is 3
Case 3: Combined array [1,2,3,4], 2nd smallest is 2

Algorithm:
Use binary search on the smaller array:
1. Ensure nums1 is the smaller array
2. Use binary search to find partition points
3. Check if partition gives exactly k elements on left
4. Adjust search range based on comparison

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ m,n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ k ≤ m+n
- -10^9 ≤ array elements ≤ 10^9
